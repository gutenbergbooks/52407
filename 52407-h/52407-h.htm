<small>TWO BOYS AND A DOG</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Two boys and a dog sat at the edge of a little
wood and shiveringly watched the eastern sky
pale from inky blue to gray. One of the boys
was white and the other was black; and the dog
was yellow. The white boy was seventeen years
old, the black boy sixteen, and the yellow dog—well,
no one knew just how old he was. The white
boy’s name was Wayne Torrence Sloan, the black
boy’s name was Junius Brutus Bartow Tasker,
and the dog’s name was Sam. An hour ago they
had been rudely awakened from their sleep in
a box car and more rudely driven forth into cold
and darkness and mystery. They had had no
complaint to make, for they had lain undisturbed
in the car ever since the middle of the previous
afternoon; and between that time and an hour
ago had rumbled and jolted over miles and miles
of track, just how many miles there was no way
of telling until, having learned their present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
whereabouts, Wayne should puzzle out the matter
of distance on the frayed and tattered time-table
in his pocket. Travelling as they had travelled,
on foot or stealing rides when the chance offered,
makes a philosopher of one, and instead of objecting
to the fate that had overtaken them when a
suspicious train hand had flashed his lantern into
the gloomy recesses of the box car, they had departed
hurriedly and in silence, being thankful
that the exodus had not been forced on them long
before.</p>

<p>Minute by minute the sky brightened. The
steely gray became softer in tone and began to
flush with a suggestion of rose. The stars paled.
A wan gleam of approaching daylight fell on one
burnished rail of the track which lay a few rods
distant. The trees behind them took on form
and substance and their naked branches became
visibly detailed against the sky. The dog whined
softly and curled himself tighter in Wayne’s arms.
Wayne stretched the corner of his gray sweater
over the thin back and eased himself from the
cramped position against the trunk of a small
tree.</p>

<p>“What would you do, June, if someone came
along about now with a can of hot coffee?” he
asked, breaking the silence that had lasted for
many minutes. The negro boy aroused from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
half doze and flashed the whites of his eyes in
the gloom.</p>

<p>“Mas’ Wayne,” he answered fervently, “I’d
jus’ about love that Mister Man. M-m-mm! Hot
coffee! Lawsy-y! You reckon it ever goin’ to
get lightsome, Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p>“I reckon we can start along pretty soon now,
June. Whereabouts do you suspect we are?”</p>

<p>“I reckon we must be gettin’ mighty nigh New
York. How far was we yesterday?”</p>

<p>“’Most two hundred and fifty miles. If we’d
just kept right on going all night we might have
been in New York right now, but that freight was
standing still more times than it was moving, I
reckon. Look yonder, June. Daylight’s surely
coming, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Junius Brutus Bartow Tasker turned an
obedient gaze toward the east, but his reply was
pessimistic. A negro who is cold is generally
pessimistic, and June was certainly cold. Unlike
Wayne, he had no sweater under his shabby
jacket, nor was there much of anything else under
it, for the coarse gingham shirt offered little resistance
to the chill of the March night, and June
and undershirts had long been strangers. Early
spring in southern Georgia is a different matter
from the same season up North, a fact which
neither boy had allowed for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“I reckon Christmas is comin’ too,” muttered
June gloomily, “but it’s a powerful long way off.
How come the nights is so long up here, Mas’
Wayne?”</p>

<p>“I reckon there isn’t any difference, not really,”
answered Wayne. “They just seem like they were
longer. Sam, you wake up and stretch yourself.
We’re going to travel again pretty soon now.
Go catch yourself a rabbit or something.”</p>

<p>The dog obeyed instructions so far as stretching
himself was concerned, and, after finding that
he was not to be allowed to return to the warmth
of his master’s lap, even set off in a half-hearted,
shivering fashion to explore the surrounding
world.</p>

<p>“I reckon he can projeck ’roun’ a mighty long
time before he starts a rabbit,” said June discouragedly.
“It’s a powerful mean-lookin’ country
up this way, ain’ it? What state you-all reckons
we’s in, Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p>Wayne shook his head. Shaking his head was
very easy because he only had to let the tremors
that were agitating the rest of him extend above
the turned-up collar of his jacket! “I reckon it
might be Maryland, June. Somewheres around
there, anyway.” He felt for the time-table in
his pocket, but he didn’t bring it forth for it was
still too dark to read. “I ’most wish I was back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
home, June,” he went on wistfully, after a
minute’s silence. “I sure do!”</p>

<p>“I done told you we hadn’t no business comin’
up this yere way. Ain’ nothin’ up here but
Northerners, I reckon. If we’d gone West like
I said we’d been a heap better off.”</p>

<p>“Nobody asked you to come, anyway,” responded
Wayne sharply. “There wasn’t any
reason for you coming. You—you just butted
in!”</p>

<p>As there was no denying that statement, June
wisely chose to change the subject. “Reckon
someone’s goin’ to give us some breakfast pretty
soon?” he asked.</p>

<p>But Wayne had a grievance now and, feeling a
good deal more homesick than he had thought he
ever could feel, and a lot colder and emptier than
was pleasant, he nursed it. “I couldn’t stay there
any longer and slave for that man,” he said. “I
stuck it out as long as I could. Ever since mother
died it’s been getting worse and worse. He hasn’t
got any hold on me, anyway. Stepfathers aren’t
kin. I had a right to run away if I wanted to, and
he can’t fetch me back, not anyway, not even by
law!”</p>

<p>“No, sir, he can’,” agreed June soothingly.</p>

<p>“But you didn’t have any right to run away,
June. You——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“How come I ain’t” demanded the negro.
“He ain’ no kin to me, neither, is he? I was jus’
a-workin’ for him. Mister Higgins ain’ got no
more ’sponsibility about me than he has about
you, Mas’ Wayne.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, June, he can fetch you back if
he ever catches you.”</p>

<p>“Can, can he? Let me tell you somethin’. He
ain’ <em>goin’</em> to catch me! Nobody ain’ goin’ to
catch me! Coloured folkses is free an’ independent
citizens, ain’ they? Ain’ they, Mas’
Wayne?”</p>

<p>“Maybe they’re free,” answered his companion
grimly, “but if you get to acting independent
I’ll just about lick the hide off you! I
ought to have done it back yonder and sent you
home where you belong.”</p>

<p>“I’se where I belong right now,” replied June
stoutly. “Ain’ we been together ever since we
was jus’ little fellers, Mas’ Wayne? Wasn’ my
mammy your mammy’s nigger for years an’
years? How come I ain’ got no right here? Ain’
my mammy always say to me, ‘You Junius
Brutus Tasker, you watch out for Young Master
an’ don’ you ever let no harm come to him, ’cause
if you do I’ll tan your hide’? Ain’ she always
tell me that ever since I was so high? What you
think I was goin’ to do, Mas’ Wayne, when I seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
you sneakin’ off that night? Wasn’ but jus’ one
thing <em>to</em> do, was there? How you ’spects I was
goin’ to watch out for you like my mammy tells
me if I didn’ go along with you? Huh? So I
jus’ track along till you get to the big road, an’
then I track along till you get to Summitty, and
then I track along——”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you climbed into that freight car
after me and the man saw you and we all got
thrown out,” continued Wayne. “I reckon you
meant all right, June, but what do you suppose
I’m going to do with you up North here? I got
to find work to do and it’s going to be hard enough
to look after Sam here without having a pesky
darkey on my hands. Best thing you can do is
hike back home before you starve to death.”</p>

<p>“Huh! I ain’ never starved to death yet, Mas’
Wayne, an’ I ain’ lookin’ to. Jus’ like I told you
heaps of times, you ain’ got to do no worryin’
about June. I reckon I can find me a job of work,
too, can’ I? Reckon folkses has to plough an’
plant an’ pick their cotton up here jus’ like they
does back home.”</p>

<p>“There isn’t any cotton in the North, June.”</p>

<p>“Ain’ no cotton?” ejaculated the other incredulously.
“What all they plant up here, then, Mas’
Wayne?”</p>

<p>“Oh, apples, I reckon, and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can pick apples, then. I done pick peaches,
ain’ I? What else they plant?”</p>

<p>“Why——” Wayne didn’t have a very clear
notion himself, but it didn’t do to appear ignorant
to June. “Why, they—they plant potatoes—white
potatoes, you know—and—and peas and—oh,
lots of things, I reckon.”</p>

<p>June pondered that in silence for a moment.
Then: “But how come they don’t plant cotton?”
he asked in puzzled tones.</p>

<p>“Too cold. It won’t grow for them up here.”</p>

<p>June gazed rather contemptuously about the
gray morning landscape and grunted comprehendingly.
“Uh-huh. Reckon I wouldn’t neither if
I was a cotton plant! It surely is a mighty—mighty
<em>mean</em>-lookin’ place, ain’ it?”</p>

<p>Well, it really was. Before them ran the
railroad embankment, behind them was the little
grove of bare trees and on either hand an uncultivated
expanse of level field stretched away into
the gray gloom. No habitation was as yet in
sight. The telegraph poles showed spectrally
against the dawn, and a little breeze, rising with
the rising sun, made a moaning sound in the
clustered wires. Sam came back from his profitless
adventures and wormed himself between
Wayne’s legs. June blew on his cold hands and
crooned a song under his breath. The eastern sky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
grew lighter and lighter and suddenly, like a
miracle, a burst of rose glow spread upward
toward the zenith, turning the grayness into the
soft hues of a dove’s breast! Wayne sprang to
his feet, with an exclamation of pain as his
cramped and chilled muscles responded to the
demand, and stretched his arms and yawned
prodigiously.</p>

<p>“Come along and let’s find that hot coffee,
June,” he said almost cheerfully. “There
must be a house somewhere around here, I
reckon.”</p>

<p>“Sure must!” replied the other, falling instantly
into Wayne’s humour. “Lawsy-y, I can
jus’ taste that coffee now! Which way we goin’,
Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p>Wayne stamped his feet on the still frosty
ground and considered. At last: “North,” he
replied, “and north’s over that way. Come
along!”</p>

<p>He led the way back toward the track, followed
by June and Sam, and after squeezing himself
between the wires of a fence climbed the embankment
and set off over the ties with a speed
born of long practice. The rose hue was fast
changing to gold now, and long rays of sunlight
streamed upward heralding the coming of His
Majesty the Sun; and against the glory of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
eastern sky the three travellers stood out like
animated silhouettes cut from blue-black cardboard
as they trudged along—<a href="#image01">the white boy, the
black boy, and the yellow dog</a>.</p>

<p>That they didn’t travel absolutely due north
was only because the track chose to lead more
westerly. By the time the sun was really in sight
they had covered the better part of a half-mile
and had caught a glimpse of a good-sized town in
the distance. Tall chimneys and a spire or two
pointed upward above a smoky haze. They
crossed a big bridge beneath which flowed a broad
and sluggish river, and had to flatten themselves
against the parapet, Sam held tightly in Wayne’s
arms, while a long freight train pounded past
them on the single line of track. Beyond the
bridge a “Yard Limit” sign met them, and the
rails branched and switches stood up here and
there like sentries and a roundhouse was near
at hand. But they found their first habitation
before that in a tiny white cottage set below the
embankment, its gate facing a rambling clay road,
rutted and pitted, that disappeared under a
bridge. There was a path worn down the bank to
the road, and Wayne and June and Sam descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
it. A trail of smoke arose from the chimney of
the house straight into the morning sunlight and
suggested that the occupants were up and about.</p>

<p>Wayne’s knock on the door was answered by a
tall, thin, slatternly woman who scowled questioningly.</p>

<p>“Good morning, ma’am,” began Wayne.
“Could you give us a cup of coffee, please? We’ve
been——”</p>

<p>“Get out of my yard,” was the prompt
response. “I don’t feed tramps!”</p>

<p>“We aren’t tramps, ma’am. We’ll pay for the
coffee——”</p>

<p>“And steal the doormat! I know your sort!”
There was no doormat in sight, but Wayne didn’t
notice the fact. “Go on now before I call my
man to you.” The door slammed shut.</p>

<p>Wayne viewed June in surprise and the negro
boy shook his head helplessly. “She surely is a
powerful disgrumpled lady, Mas’ Wayne! Yes,
sir! Reckon we better move along.”</p>

<p>“Maybe she isn’t well,” said Wayne, as they
left the inhospitable dwelling behind and again
climbed to the track. “Just the same, she didn’t
have any right to call us tramps, did she? I
suppose we’d better keep on to the town, June.
It isn’t much farther.”</p>

<p>So they went on, past sidings laden with long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
lines of freight cars, past locomotives sizzling
idly, past a crossing where eight burnished rails,
aglow in the sunlight, crossed their path, under a
big signal tower, their eyes very busy and their
stomachs, since they had not eaten since early the
preceding afternoon, very empty. A long freight
shed was reached, and as they passed it one of the
many doors slid slowly open and a brawny man
stood revealed against the dimness beyond. He
stretched his arms, yawned, caught sight of
the passers and stood there, framed in the
square opening, staring interestedly. Wayne
stopped.</p>

<p>“Howdy,” he said. “Can you tell me where
I can get something to eat, sir?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Cross over back of the yellow building
and you’ll see a lunch-wagon. Maybe you’re looking
for the hotel, though?”</p>

<p>Wayne shook his head. “I reckon a lunch-wagon’s
good enough. What is this place,
please?”</p>

<p>“Medfield, son. Aren’t lost, are you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. What—what state are we in?”</p>

<p>“Pennsylvania. What state might you be looking
for, son?”</p>

<p>“New York. Is it very far?”</p>

<p>“Second state on the right,” laughed the man.
“What part of it are you aiming for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“New York City, I reckon. How far would that
be?”</p>

<p>“About a hundred and fifty miles.”</p>

<p>Wayne sighed. “I thought we were nearer than
that. Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p>“Say, hold on! Where’d you come from, anyway?”</p>

<p>Wayne pointed a thumb over his shoulder.
“Back there a ways,” he answered vaguely.</p>

<p>“Tramping it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, some. Rode on the cars, too.”</p>

<p>The big man in the doorway winked down at
him. “When they didn’t see you, eh? You look
like a smart kid. What are you beating your way
around the country for? Why don’t you get a
job and go to work?”</p>

<p>“I’m looking for work,” answered Wayne
eagerly. “Know where I can find some?”</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders. “I guess you
won’t have to look very far, son, if you really
want a job. The trouble with your sort is that
you don’t <em>want</em> to work. How far south do you
come from?”</p>

<p>“Georgia, sir. How’d you know?”</p>

<p>“How’d I know!” laughed the man. “That’s
a good one! What’s Friday’s name?”</p>

<p>“What, sir?” asked Wayne, puzzled.</p>

<p>The man nodded at Wayne’s companion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
“What’s his name? Abraham Lincoln
White?”</p>

<p>“June,” answered Wayne, a trifle stiffly, beginning
to suspect that the man was laughing at
him.</p>

<p>“June, eh? Say, he got North about three
months too soon, didn’t he? Where’d you get the
alligator hound? Don’t you ever feed him anything?”</p>

<p>Wayne moved away, followed by his retinue, but
the man in the door was blind to offended dignity.
“All right, son!” he called after them. “Good
luck! Tell Denny that Jim Mason sent you and
that he’s to give you a good feed.”</p>

<p>Wayne found the lunch-wagon without difficulty,
but it didn’t seem to him that it deserved
the name of wagon for it was set on a brick
foundation in a weed-grown piece of land under
the shadow of the big yellow factory and looked
as though it had been there for many years.
Still, there might be wheels hidden behind the
bricks, he reflected. The words “Golden Star
Lunch” were painted on the front. They climbed
the steps and seated themselves on stools, while
Sam searched famishedly about the floor for stray
crumbs. The proprietor was a short, chunky
youth with light hair slicked down close and a
generous supply of the biggest and reddest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
freckles Wayne had ever seen. He observed June
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“We don’t generally feed niggers here,” he
said. “You two fellers together?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Wayne. “If you don’t want
to serve him we’ll get out.” He started to slide
off the stool.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, never mind,” said the white-aproned
youth. “The rush is over now. What’ll you
have?”</p>

<p>“Coffee and two ham sandwiches, please.”</p>

<p>“Mas’ Wayne,” said June, “I’d rather have a
piece of that sweet-potato pie yonder, please, sir.”</p>

<p>“That ain’t sweet-potato pie,” laughed the
proprietor. “That’s squash, Snowball.”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, Mister, don’t call me out of my
name,” begged June earnestly. “My name’s
Junius.”</p>

<p>“All right, Junius.” The proprietor of the
lunch-wagon grinned at Wayne and winked, but
Wayne only frowned.</p>

<p>“You’ll have a sandwich, June,” he said.
“Pie isn’t good for you. Two ham sandwiches,
please.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p>June watched wistfully while the knife slipped
through the end of the ham, and at last hunger got
the better of manners. “Mister Denny, sir, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
you please, sir, just bear down a little heavier on
that fat meat?” he requested.</p>

<p>“Sure, you can have all the fat you want.
How’d you know my name, though?”</p>

<p>Wayne answered for him. “A man at the
freight shed directed us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and he said we was to tell you to give
us a mighty good feed, Mister Denny,” added
June. “But I reckon you-all goin’ to do that
anyway, ain’ you?”</p>

<p>The proprietor laughed as he covered two
slices of buttered bread with generous slices of
ham. “That’s right, Snow—I mean Junius,” he
responded. “If that ain’t enough you come back.
Want something for your dog?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, I’ll give him some of my sandwich,”
said Wayne, trying not to look impatient.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to.” The man scooped up
some trimmings from the ham on the blade of the
broad knife, dumped them on a slice of bread and
leaned over the counter. “Here you are, Bingo.
Catch!” Sam caught as much as he could and it
disappeared as though by magic. After that he
licked up the few scraps that had got away from
him, wagged his tail delightedly, and gazed inquiringly
and invitingly up again. “Say, he’s a
smart dog, ain’t he?” said the man. “What’s his
name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sam. Are those sandwiches ready, please?”</p>

<p>“Huh? Gee, didn’t I serve you yet? What do
you know about that? Coffee, you said, didn’t
you? Here you are.” He went back to an appraisal
of the dog while Wayne and June, side
by side, drank deep draughts of the hot coffee and
bit huge mouthfuls from the delicious sandwiches.
“Guess some more breakfast wouldn’t bust him,”
said the proprietor, cutting off another slice of
bread and buttering it liberally. “Can he do any
tricks?”</p>

<p>“A few,” replied Wayne rather inarticulately
by reason of having his mouth occupied by other
things than words. “Sit up, Sam, and ask for
it.”</p>

<p>Sam sat up, a trifle unsteadily, and barked three
shrill barks. The man laughed. “Good boy!
Here you are, then!” The piece of bread disappeared
instantly. “Say, he’s sure hungry!
What kind of a dog is he?”</p>

<p>“Reckon he’s just dog,” answered Wayne.
“He don’t boast of his family much, Sam don’t,
but he’s a good old chap.”</p>

<p>“Man over yonder at the railroad called him a
alligator hound,” said June resentfully. “That’s
the best dog in Colquitt County, Mister Denny.
Yes, sir!”</p>

<p>“Where’s that, Junius?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Colquitt? That’s where we lives at when
we’re to home. Colquitt County’s the finest——”</p>

<p>“Shut up, June. Don’t talk so much,” said
Wayne. “Sam, stand up and march for the
gentleman. Come on! Forward! March!”</p>

<p>Sam removed his appealing gaze from the
countenance of “Mister Denny,” sighed—you
could actually hear that sigh!—reared himself on
his slender hind legs and stepped stiffly down the
length of the floor and back again.</p>

<p>“Halt!” commanded Wayne, and Sam halted so
suddenly that he almost went over backward.
“Salute!” Sam’s right paw flopped up and down
in a sketchy salute. “Fall out!” Sam came down
on all-fours with alacrity, barked his relief and
again took up his station under the good-natured
“Mr. Denny.” The latter applauded warmly.</p>

<p>“Some dog you’ve got there, kid!” he declared.
“What’ll you take for him?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t sell him,” answered Wayne, washing
down the last of his sandwich with the final
mouthful of coffee.</p>

<p>“Give you ten dollars,” said the man.</p>

<p>Wayne shook his head with decision.</p>

<p>“Fifteen? Well, any time you do want to sell
him, Mister, you give me first chance, will you?
He’s going to have some more breakfast for that
stunt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mas’ Wayne,” said June softly, “I ain’ never
eat any of that squash pie, an’ it surely does look
powerful handsome, don’ it?”</p>

<p>“You still hungry?” frowned Wayne.</p>

<p>“I ain’ downright hungry,” answered June
wistfully, “but I—I surely would act awful kind
to a piece of that pie!”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Wayne. “How much is pie,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Five cents. Want some?”</p>

<p>“Please. A slice of the squash.”</p>

<p>The proprietor, too busy with Sam to
have heard the exchange, set the pie in front
of Wayne, and the latter pushed it along to
June.</p>

<p>“Did you say two pieces?” asked the man,
poising his knife.</p>

<p>“No, thank you.”</p>

<p>June looked uncertainly from the tempting
yellow triangle on the plate before him to Wayne
and back again. “Ain’ you-all goin’ to have no
pie?” he asked. Wayne shook his head. June
laid down the fork and sniffed doubtfully. “What
kind of pie you say this is, Mister Denny?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Huh? Squash pie.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. I reckon I don’ care for it, thanky,
sir. It don’ smell like I thought it would.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool!” whispered Wayne. “I don’t
want any.”</p>

<p>“Say you don’? I ain’ believin’ it, though.
Please, Mas’ Wayne, you have a half of it. It’s
a powerful big piece of pie.”</p>

<p>“Lots more here,” said the proprietor. “Want
another piece?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks,” answered Wayne. “I—maybe
I’ll take a bite of his.”</p>

<p>The man’s reply to this was a quick slash of his
knife and a second section of the squash pie slid
across the counter. “My treat,” he said. “Try
it. It’s good pie.”</p>

<p>Wayne hesitated. “I don’t think I want any,”
he muttered. “I’m not hungry.”</p>

<p>“You eat it if you don’t want me to get mad at
you,” said the other, levelling the knife at him
sternly. “If you can’t eat it all give it to Sam.
I’ll bet you he likes pie, eh, Sammy?”</p>

<p>Wayne smiled and, to June’s vast relief, ate.
Perhaps he wasn’t hungry and perhaps it was
mere politeness that caused him to consume every
last crumb, but he had the appearance of one in
thorough enjoyment of his task. When both
plates were cleaned up Wayne dug a hand into a
pocket.</p>

<p>“How much do we owe you, please?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Twenty cents. The pie was on me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d rather—rather——” Wayne’s remark
dwindled to silence and he began an anxious
search of all his pockets, a proceeding that
brought a look of suspicion into the good-natured
face of the man behind the counter.</p>

<p>“Lost your money?” asked the latter with a
trace of sarcasm.</p>

<p>Wayne nodded silently. “I reckon I must
have,” he muttered, turning out one pocket after
another and assembling the contents on the
counter; the tattered time-table, a toothbrush, a
pair of stockings, two handkerchiefs, a knife, a
pencil, some string, and two-cent stamp vastly
the worse for having laid crumpled up in a vest
pocket for many weeks. “It—it’s gone,” said
Wayne blankly. “I had nearly four dollars last
night, didn’t I, June?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, you certainly did, Mas’ Wayne,
’cause I seen it. Where you reckon you lost it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered the other boy
miserably. “It was in this pocket. I reckon it
must have come out in the freight car.”</p>

<p>The proprietor of the lunch wagon frowned. It
was an old game to him, but there was something
apparently genuine in the troubled expressions of
both boys and he was almost inclined to accept
the story. At all events, it was only twenty cents,
and he was good-hearted and the two youngsters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
looked rather down on their luck. “Well, never
mind,” he said carelessly. “You can pay me
some other time, kids.”</p>

<p>But Wayne shook his head. “You—you haven’t
any money, have you, June?” he faltered. June
shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t have but two bits, Mas’ Wayne, and
I went an’ spent that long time ago.”</p>

<p>“You see,” said Wayne, turning to the proprietor,
“we don’t live here. We’re just—just
passing through on our way to New York, and so
we couldn’t very well pay you later.” He looked
dubiously at the array of property before him.
“I reckon there ain’t anything there worth twenty
cents, is there?”</p>

<p>“Not to me, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Then—then you’ll just have to keep Sam until
we can bring the money,” said Wayne desperately.
“I reckon we can earn it somewhere. Will
you please to do that, sir?”</p>

<p>The man looked covetously at the dog, but shook
his head. “Shucks,” he answered, “he’d only be
unhappy. And so would you, I guess. You run
along, fellers. It’s all right. I guess you’ll pay
me when you can, eh? Only—say, now, honest,
kid, did you really have that four dollars, or are
you just stringing me?”</p>

<p>Wayne flushed but met the man’s gaze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
squarely. “I had it,” he replied simply. “You
haven’t any call to think I’m lying.”</p>

<p>“All right! I believe you. Now, look here, do
you really want to earn a half-dollar?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ever washed windows?”</p>

<p>Wayne shook his head. “No, but I reckon I
could do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, these windows need washing pretty
badly. Generally I do it myself, but I’d rather
take a lickin’. There’s eight of ’em and it ought
to be worth five cents a window. That’s forty
cents, but we’ll call it fifty. What do you say?”</p>

<p>“I’ll do them, thanks, and mighty glad to,”
answered Wayne eagerly.</p>

<p>“Huh!” ejaculated June. “Go on away from
here, Mas’ Wayne. You ain’ never washed no
window in your life. White man, point me out to
water and rags and <em>let</em> me to it. Mas’ Wayne ain’
never done no work like that an’ there ain’ no call
for him to do any.” June paused and looked at
the windows. “Mister Denny, them’s pretty big
windows an’ they certainly is dirty, ain’ they?”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you? Ain’t fifty cents
enough?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” answered June slowly, “it is an’ it
ain’. Takin’ into estimation the size of them
windows an’ the ’mount of washin’ required, sir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
it seems like you might throw in two more cups
of that yere coffee, sir!”</p>

<p>“Junius, you’re all right!” laughed the man,
turning to the gleaming coffee urn. “It’s a bargain.
Drink your coffee and then get to work.
If you do a good job I’ll throw in a sandwich when
you’re through!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>THE SEARCH FOR WORK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Two hours later the boys, followed by Sam, left
the lunch-wagon, possessed of thirty cents in
money and with all liabilities discharged. Wayne,
declaring that, although he had never washed a
window in his life, it was time he learned how, had,
to June’s disgust, taken a hand in the work, and,
while he had done only three windows to June’s
five, had proved his ability. Afterward, Mr.
Dennis Connor—for that, as they later learned,
was his real name—had provided a collation of
sandwiches and coffee and dismissed them with
his good wishes and an invitation to drop in again
when they were passing.</p>

<p>It was mid-morning now, and the sunshine had
warmed the early March day to a temperature
more kindly than any they had experienced for
a week. Wayne led the way to a sheltered nook
in the lee of an empty shed near the railroad
and seated himself on a discarded wheelbarrow.
June followed suit and Sam began an excited
search for rats. The town was wide-awake and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
very busy now. Smoke poured from neighbouring
stacks and chimneys and the roar of machinery
came to them from the big factory close
by. Trains passed and locomotives shrieked and
clanged their brazen bells. Drays and trucks
moved noisily along the cobbled street in the
direction of the freight yard, piled high with
goods in bales and boxes.</p>

<p>“Reckon,” said June, “this is a right smart
town, Mas’ Wayne.”</p>

<p>Wayne nodded. He was still regretting the loss
of his money and now he reverted to the question
of how and where he had parted from it. They
discussed it at some length and eventually decided
that it had somehow got out of his pocket last
night in the freight car. To be quite, quite certain
that it was really gone, Wayne once more emptied
his pockets and turned them all inside out. But
the money was not there and June shook his kinky
head in silent sympathy. Sam gave up his rat
hunt and threw himself, panting, in the sunlight
at the boys’ feet.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s gone,” said Wayne finally. “And
there’s no use crying about it. But what I want
to know is how we’re to get to New York on thirty
cents. That man said it was about a hundred and
fifty miles and I reckon it’ll take us ’most a week,
don’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Depends,” said June. “If we’s lucky and gets
plenty of free rides——”</p>

<p>“They’re too particular around here,” interrupted
Wayne sadly. “I reckon it’ll be mighty
hard to get into freight cars after this, June.
We’ll just have to foot it, and thirty cents won’t
last long on the road. Folks ain’t awfully hospitable
up North, I’ve heard, and we can’t depend
on getting meals free. Anyway, I don’t want to.
It’s too much like begging. That man as much
as called us tramps, and that woman said we
<em>were</em> tramps. Well, we aren’t. We’ve paid for
everything anyone would let us pay for, so far,
excepting the rides we stole, and those don’t count,
I reckon. Seems to me like the only thing to
do now, June, is to stay right here and earn
some money before we go any further. There’s
no use trying to walk to New York with only
thirty cents.”</p>

<p>June agreed cheerfully enough to that proposition.
After all, it made little difference to him.
New York City or Medfield, it was all one. To
be sure, they had started out for New York, but
it was Wayne who had settled on that place as
their destination, and June would have been just
as well satisfied if Wayne had decided for Reykjavik,
Iceland. Besides, it was now almost three
weeks since they had stolen away from Sleepersville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Georgia, and June’s first enthusiasm for
wandering had faded sadly. In short, the idea of
remaining stationary in one place for a while
struck him as being very attractive. And perhaps
the same thought came to Wayne, for, having
reached the decision, he sighed as if with relief.
It may have been, probably was, merely a coincidence,
but Sam, stretched flat on the ground at
Wayne’s feet, echoed the sigh.</p>

<p>Perhaps no better opportunity will present itself
for a study of our hero and his companions
and so we will make the most of it. Wayne
Sloan was seventeen years old; to be exact,
seventeen years and nineteen days. It had been
the arrival of his seventeenth birthday that had
decided him to cast off the yoke of thraldom and
become his own master. He was a capable-looking
youth, fairly large for his age. He had wide
shoulders and carried himself straightly, a fact
largely due, I fancy, to many hours spent in the
saddle in his younger days. After the death of
his mother, which had occurred four years ago,
there had been neither saddle nor horse for him,
nor, had there been a horse, would there have been
opportunity for riding. His stepfather had his
own notions regarding the proper occupations for
a boy, notions that were at wide variance with
Wayne’s. Handsome the boy was not, but you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
would have called him nice-looking. You’d have
liked his eyes, which were so deeply brown that
they seemed black, and the oval smoothness of
his face which lacked the colourlessness of so
many Southern faces. His hair was fully as dark
as his eyes and as straight as an Indian’s, and
just now, by reason of not having been cut for
a month or so, was rather untidy about ears and
neck. His nose was—well, it was just a plain,
everyday affair, meriting no especial mention.
And his mouth was no more remarkable. In fact,
there was nothing to emphasise, from head to
toes. He was just a nice-appearing, well-built
Southern boy. At present his appearance was
rather handicapped by his attire, for even the
best of clothes will look shabby after nearly three
weeks of dusty roads and dirty box cars, and
Wayne’s apparel had not been anything to brag
about in the beginning. A pair of gray trousers
that only the most charitable would have called
woolen, a vest of the same, a coat of blue serge,
and a gray sweater comprised the more important
part of his outfit. A black felt hat of the Fedora
variety, ridiculously old-looking for the boyish
face beneath, dark-blue cotton socks showing
above a pair of rusty, dusty, scuffed-toed shoes,
and a wispy blue string tie peering from under
the wrinkled collar of a blue-and-white cotton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
shirt completed as much of his wardrobe as met
the world’s gaze.</p>

<p>But in the matter of wardrobe Wayne at least
had the better of his companion. Junius Brutus
Bartow Tasker was never a dandy. Just something
to cover him up more or less was all June
asked. His shoes, which had been new just before
the beginning of the present pilgrimage, were the
most presentable item of his attire. They only
needed blacking. The other things he wore needed
about everything, including patches, buttons, and
cleaning! His cheap cotton trousers would have
proved an embarrassment to anyone of a less
philosophical nature, his shirt was sadly torn and
his coat—well, that coat had been a wreck a year
ago and had not improved any since! Between
the tops of his shoes and the frayed bottoms of
his trousers appeared a crinkled expanse of gray
yarn socks, to the public all that socks should
be, but to June only two hollow mockeries. Below
his ankle bones lay ruin and desolation. On his
kinky head was a brown felt, or what had once
been a brown felt. It no longer deserved serious
consideration as a head covering. But all this
didn’t bother June much. As I have already
hinted, he was a philosopher, and a cheerful one.
You had only to look at him to realise that. He
had a perfectly round face, as round as a cannon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
ball—and lots blacker—a pair of merry brown
eyes which rolled ludicrously under the stress of
emotion, a wide, vividly red mouth filled with
startlingly white teeth, a nose no flatter than was
appropriate to one of his race, and ears that stood
out inquiringly at right angles. He looked and
was intelligent, and, barring the colour of his skin,
was not greatly different in essentials from the
white boy beside him. June was sixteen, as near
as he could tell; his mother’s memory for ages
was uncertain, and June couldn’t consult his
father on the question for the simple reason that
his father had disappeared very soon after June’s
arrival in the world. Besides, there were five
other youthful Taskers, some older and some
younger, and June’s mother might well be excused
for uncertainty as to the exact age of any
one of them.</p>

<p>We have left only one member of the trio to be
described, and his outward appearance may be
told in few words. Sam was small, yellowish and
alert. He had been intended for a fox terrier,
perhaps, but had received the wrong colouring.
In Missouri or Mississippi he would have been
labelled “fice,” which is equivalent to saying that
he was a terrier-like dog of no particular breed.
But like many of his sort, Sam made up for his
lack of aristocracy by possessing all the virtues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
that one demands in a dog. That small head of
his contained a brain that must have felt absolutely
crowded! I dare say that that is the way the
Lord makes it up to little, no-account yellow dogs
like Sam. He gives them big brains and big
hearts, and so they get through life without ever
feeling the want of blue ribbons on their collars.
It would, I think, have been a frightful shock to
Sam if anyone had tied a ribbon on him, blue or
any other colour! He wouldn’t have approved a
bit. In fact, he would have been most unhappy
until he had gotten it off and tried the taste of it.
So far no one had ever attempted such an indignity.
Even a collar was something that Sam had
his doubts about. When he had one he put up with
it uncomplainingly, but you could see that it
didn’t make him a bit happier. Just now he
wore a leather strap about his neck. It had once
been used to hold Wayne’s schoolbooks together,
but Sam didn’t know that, and wouldn’t have
cared if he had. I forgot to say that a perfectly
good tail had been early sacrificed to the dictates
of an inhuman fashion, and that now only a scant
two inches remained. To see Sam wag that two
inches made you realise what a perfectly glorious
time he could have had with the whole appendage
had it been left to him. Sometimes in moments
of strong mental excitement his keen, affectionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
brown eyes seemed trying to say something like
that! But my few words have grown too many,
and I find that I have devoted nearly as much
space to Sam as to his master. But as Sam is
not likely to receive much attention hereafter let
us not begrudge it to him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Wayne had laid his plans. If thirty
cents was not sufficient to finance the journey to
New York, neither was it sufficient to provide
food and lodging for them indefinitely in Medfield.
Consequently, it behooved them to add to that
sum by hook or by crook, and it was decided that
they should begin right away and look for work
to do. With that object in view they presently
left the sunny side of the little shed and set off,
Wayne and Sam in one direction and June in
another, to reassemble at twilight. Wayne
wanted June to take ten of the precious thirty
cents to buy luncheon with, but June scoffed. “I
don’t need no ten cents, Mas’ Wayne,”
he declared. “I can find me somethin’ to eat
without no ten cents. An’ I don’t need nothin’
else, anyhow, not before night. I’m jus’ plumb
full of food now!”</p>

<p>Wayne’s experiences that day were disheartening.
Medfield was a town of nearly thirty
thousand inhabitants, but not one of that number,
it appeared, was in need of Wayne’s services,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
nor cared whether he lived or starved. He made
his way to the centre of the town and visited store
after store, and office after office, climbing many
weary flights and knocking at many inhospitable
doors while Sam waited outside in patient resignation.
At noon Wayne lunched in a shabby and
none-too-clean little restaurant on five cents’ worth
of beef stew and two pieces of bread, feeling a bit
panicky as he did so, because five from thirty left
only what June would have called “two bits” and
Wayne a quarter, and which, no matter what you
called it, was a frighteningly small amount of
money to have between you and nothing. But
he felt a heap better after that stew and went
back to his task with more courage. Sam felt
better, too, for he had had a whole slice of bread
dipped in gravy and a nice gristly bone.</p>

<p>The trouble was that when, as happened very
infrequently, to be sure, but did happen, he was
asked what he could do he had to answer either
“Anything” or “Nothing.” Of course he chose
to say “Anything,” but the result was always
disappointing. As one crabbed, much-bewhiskered
man in a hardware store told him, “Anything
means nothing.” After that Wayne boldly presented
himself at the busy office of a dry-goods
emporium and offered himself as a bookkeeper.
It was more a relief than a disappointment when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the dapper man in charge informed him, after a
dubious examination of his attire, that there was
no present vacancy. Wayne was conscious of the
amused glances of the men at the desks as he
hurried out. It was almost dusk when he finally
gave up and turned his steps toward the deserted
shed near the railway. He had trouble in finding
it, walking many blocks out of his way and for a
space fearing that darkness would overtake him
before he reached it. In the end it was Sam who
kept him from making a second mistake, for
Wayne was for passing the shed a block away
until the dog’s insistence on turning down a dim,
cobble-paved street brought the search to an end.</p>

<p>June was already on hand, squatting comfortably
on the wheelbarrow and crooning to himself
in the twilight. Sam showed his delight in the
reunion by licking June’s face while Wayne discouragedly
lowered himself to a seat at the
darkey’s side.</p>

<p>“Any luck?” he asked tiredly.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ permanent, Mas’ Wayne, but I done
earned us another two bits. This is a right smart
town, this is. Nobody don’t have to go hungry in
this town, no, sir!”</p>

<p>Wayne tried to keep the envy out of his voice
as he answered: “That’s great, June. How did
you do it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“Man was rollin’ barrels up a board to a wagon
and every time he got a barrel half-way up the
board his horses would start a-movin’ off an’ he’d
jus’ have to drop that barrel an’ run to their
heads. I ask him, ‘Please, sir, don’t you want me
to hold ’em for you?’ An’ he ’lowed he did. An’
I say, ‘How much you goin’ to give me, sir?’
And he say if I hold ’em till he got his wagon
loaded he’d give me a quarter. ’Twan’t no time
till he had the barrels on an’ I had his ol’ quarter
in my jeans. Then I see a funny little man with
gold rings in his ears sittin’ on a step sellin’
candy, an’ funny twisty pieces of bread an’
apples, an’ things. An’ I say to him, ‘How much
are your apples, Boss?’ An’ he say, ‘They’re two
for five cents.’ ‘Huh,’ I say, ‘they give ’em poor
old apples away where I come from.’ An’ he
want to know where was I come from, an’ I tell
him, an’ we had a right sociable time a-talkin’ an’
all, an’ pretty soon he find a apple had a rotten
spot on it an’ give it to me. An’ after a while I
say, ‘Boss, what you-all call them funny, curly
things you got on that stick?’ An’ he ’lows they’s—they’s——”
June wrinkled his forehead until
it had almost as many corrugations as a washboard—“I
reckon I forget what he call them,
Mas’ Wayne.”</p>

<p>“What were they like, June?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, sir, they was bow-knots made of bread,
an’ they tasted mighty scrumptious. Seems like
they was called ‘pistols’ or somethin’.”</p>

<p>“Pretzels, June?”</p>

<p>“That’s it! Pretzels! You know them things,
Mas’ Wayne?” Wayne shook his head. “Well,
sir, they’s mighty good eatin’.”</p>

<p>“Did he give you one?” asked Wayne smiling.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he surely did. I say I ain’ never eat
one an’ he say if I have a penny I could have
one. ‘Go long, Mister Man,’ I say, ‘I ain’ got no
penny. How come you ’spects I got all that
money?’ An’ he laugh an’ say, ‘Well, maybe I
give you one, Black Boy, if you don’ tell someone
elses.’ He had funny way of talkin’, that
man. So I say I won’t ever tell——”</p>

<p>“But you have told,” laughed Wayne.</p>

<p>June rolled his eyes. “That’s so! I plumb
forget!”</p>

<p>“Was that all the lunch you had?” asked
Wayne.</p>

<p>June nodded. “Was all I wanted,” he declared
stoutly. “Apples is powerful fillin’ fruit, Mas’
Wayne. What-all did you have?”</p>

<p>Wayne told him and June pretended to think
very little of it. “That ain’ white man’s food,”
he declared. “Old stewed-up beef ain’ fit rations
for you. No, sir, ’tain’! Don’t you go insultin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
your stomach like that no more, Mas’ Wayne,
’cause if you do you’re goin’ to be sick an’ me an’
Sam’ll have to nurse you. Now you tell me
what-all did you do, please.”</p>

<p>Wayne soon told him and June shook his head
and made sympathetic noises in his throat during
the brief recital. “Don’t you mind ’em, Mas’
Wayne,” he said when the other had finished.
“Somebody’s goin’ to be powerful glad to give
you a job tomorrow. You wait an’ see if they
ain’.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do anything, I’m afraid,” said Wayne
despondently. “They all ask me what I can do
and I have to tell them ‘Nothing.’ I can’t even
wash windows decently!”</p>

<p>“Who say you can do nothin’?” demanded
June indignantly. “I reckon you’re a heap
smarter than these yere Northerners! Ain’ you
been to school an’ learn all about everythin’?
Geography an’ ’rithmatic an’ algebrum an’ all?
What for you say you don’ know nothin’?”</p>

<p>Wayne laughed wanly. “Arithmetic and those
things aren’t much use to a fellow, it seems to me,
when he’s looking for work. If I’d learned bookkeeping
I might get a job.”</p>

<p>“You done kep’ them books for your stepdaddy.”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t real bookkeeping, June. Anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
could do that. The only things I can do aren’t
much use up here; like ride and shoot a little
and——”</p>

<p>“An’ knock the leather off’n a baseball,” added
June.</p>

<p>“I guess no one’s going to pay me for doing
that,” commented Wayne, with a smile. “Well,
there’s no use borrowing trouble, I reckon. There
must be something I can do, June, and I’ll find it
sooner or later. I reckon I made a mistake in
going around to the offices. If I’d tried the warehouses
and factories I might have found something.
That’s what I’ll do tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“You goin’ to set yourself some mighty hard
work, Mas’ Wayne, if you get foolin’ ’roun’ the
factories. Better leave that kind of work for me,
sir. That’s nigger work, that is.”</p>

<p>“It’s white men’s work up here in the North,
June. I’m strong enough and I’m willing, and
I’m just going to find something tomorrow.
Question now is, June, where are we going to
get our supper and where are we going to sleep?
Fifty cents will buy supper but it won’t buy beds,
too.”</p>

<p>“I been thinkin’ about that sleepin’ business,”
answered June. “I reckon we can’ do no better
than stay right where we is.”</p>

<p>“Here?” asked Wayne. “Someone would come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
along and arrest us or something. Besides, a
wheelbarrow——”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I don’ mean out here. I mean in
yonder.” June nodded toward the old shed beside
them. “I was projeckin’ roun’ before you-all
come back an’ there ain’ nothin’ wrong with this
yere little house, Mas’ Wayne.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Wayne. “Is it empty?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it surely is empty. There ain’ nothin’
in there but empty. It ’pears like it used to be a
store, ’cause there’s shelves up the walls. An’
there’s a floor, too.”</p>

<p>“Do we sleep on the floor or the shelves?”
asked Wayne.</p>

<p>“Shelves is too narrow,” chuckled June. “If
we jus’ had a blanket or two, now, I reckon we’d
be mighty comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Might as well wish for a bed with a hair
mattress and pillows and sheets,” answered
Wayne. “But I’d rather sleep under a roof tonight
than outdoors, so we’ll just be glad of the
shed, June. Now let’s go and find us some supper.
Come on, Sam, you rascal!”</p>

<p>If one is tired enough such luxuries as beds and
blankets may be dispensed with. Wayne and June
slept more uninterruptedly that night than for
many nights past. Toward morning they were
conscious of the cold, for Wayne’s coat and an
old gunny-sack discovered in a corner of the shed
were not sufficient to more than cover their feet
and legs. Sam, curled up in Wayne’s arms, doubtless
fared better than the boys. When morning
came they were stiff and achy and were glad
enough to get up at the first signs of sunrise and
move around. The want of a place to wash resulted
in the discovery of a veritable haven of
warmth and rest, for Wayne, peering about from
the front of the shed, descried the railroad station
only a few blocks down the track, and toward
that they made their way. They found the waiting-room
door unlocked and warmth and comfort
inside. After washing up they settled themselves
on a bench removed from the sight of the ticket
window and fairly luxuriated in the warmth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
June fell asleep again and snored so loudly that
Wayne had to arouse him for fear that someone
would hear him and drive them out. Wayne himself
didn’t actually slumber, but he leaned back
in a half-doze that was almost as restful as sleep,
and Sam, restraining his desire to investigate
these new surroundings, presently slept, too.</p>

<p>It was hunger that finally aroused them to
action. The clock on the wall told them that it
was almost half-past seven, and they left the
waiting-room and passed out again into the chill
of the March morning. But the sun was shining
strongly now and there was a spring softness in
the air that made June whistle gaily as they made
their way back up the railroad in search of
“Mister Denny’s” lunch-wagon. There they had
some steaming hot coffee, and some crisp rolls and
butter and, since there was still a nickel in the
exchequer, three bananas which they consumed
outside. To be sure, that left them penniless, but
somehow that didn’t seem to matter so much this
morning. There was something in the spring-like
air that gave them courage and confidence. Besides,
whatever happened, they had a home, such
as it was, in the old shed. Presently they again
set forth on their search for employment, agreeing
to meet at five o’clock.</p>

<p>But again it was June who prospered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Wayne who returned empty-handed. June
proudly displayed forty cents in dimes and nickels
which he had earned in as many capacities as
there were coins in his hand. Not only had he
earned that forty cents, but he had dined sumptuously
on a pork chop, having traded a quarter
of an hour of his time and labour for that delicacy
at a little restaurant. For his part, Wayne had
gone dinnerless and was thoroughly discouraged.
Even the tattered but still useful horse blanket
which June had picked up outside a flour mill
across the town could not cheer Wayne’s spirits.</p>

<p>“Reckon,” said June, spreading the blanket out
proudly, “someone done lose that as didn’t mean
to, Mas’ Wayne, ’cause it’s a powerful nice
blanket, ain’ it?” Wayne listlessly agreed and
June dropped it through the window which was
their means of ingress and egress. “It’s goin’
to keep us fine an’ warm tonight, that little ol’
blanket is. Tomorrow I’m goin’ to find me a bed
to go with it! You hungry enough to eat, Mas’
Wayne?”</p>

<p>Wayne shook his head. “I don’t want any
supper,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Don’ want no supper! How come? What-all
you have for your dinner, please?”</p>

<p>“I had enough,” answered Wayne. “You go
ahead and have your supper, June.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>June snorted. “Mighty likely, ain’ it?” he demanded
scathingly. “Reckon you can see this
nigger eatin’ all by his lonely. No, sir, Mas’
Wayne, you-all’s goin’ to eat, too. If you don’
there ain’ goin’ to be no supper for nobody.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I’m not hungry,” replied Wayne
irritably. “Besides, if you must know, I haven’t
any money.”</p>

<p>“Say you ain’? You’ve got forty cents. How
come that ain’ enough money to buy us some
supper?”</p>

<p>“That’s your money, not mine,” said Wayne
bitterly. “You earned it. I didn’t. I’m not
going to live off you. You go get your supper
and let me alone.”</p>

<p>“I earned it for all of us,” said June earnestly.
“Reckon you paid a heap of money to buy victuals
for me, Mas’ Wayne, all the way up from Sleepersville,
didn’ you, sir?”</p>

<p>“That’s different,” muttered the other.</p>

<p>“How come it’s different? Please, sir, don’
you be uppity an’ proud. Ever since we was little
fellers together, Mas’ Wayne, you done give me
money; two bits here, an’ two bits there, an’ a
dime yonder. How come I can’ pay it back to
you?”</p>

<p>“A gentleman doesn’t—doesn’t do that,” returned
Wayne stubbornly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“You mean ’cause you’re white an’ I’m black?”</p>

<p>“Never mind what I mean. Anyway, I’m not
hungry, so shut up.”</p>

<p>June obeyed, scuffling his shoes in the cinders
underfoot and staring sadly at the sunset glow
beyond the factory roofs to the west. Sam had
found a very old and very dry bone somewhere
and was pretending that it was quite new and
delicious. He even growled once or twice, although
there was no other dog in sight, perhaps
to convince himself that he really had discovered
a prize. Minutes passed and the western sky
faded from crimson to yellow, and from yellow to
gray. Finally Wayne stole a look at June.</p>

<p>“You’d better be going,” he growled.</p>

<p>“I ain’ aimin’ to go, Mas’ Wayne,” replied
June earnestly. “Reckon I ain’ no hungrier than
you is.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care whether you are or not,” declared
the other angrily. “I say you’re to go and get
some supper. Now you go.”</p>

<p>June shook his head. “Not without you come
along,” he answered.</p>

<p>“You do as I tell you, June!”</p>

<p>“I’m wishin’ to, Mas’ Wayne, but I jus’ can’,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, you just will! If you don’t start right
along I’ll whale you, Junius!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir, Mas’ Wayne, you can do that, but
you-all can’ make me eat no supper. That’s
somethin’ you <em>can’</em> do.”</p>

<p>“If you can’t do as I tell you you’ll have to get
out. You think just because you’re up North
here you can do as you please. Well, I’ll show
you. Are you going to obey me?”</p>

<p>“Please, sir, Mas’ Wayne, I’m goin’ to do
everythin’ just like you tell me, savin’ that! I
jus’ can’ go an’ eat anythin’ ’less you come
along. I’m powerful sorry, hones’ to goodness,
Mas’ Wayne, but you can see how ’tis.”</p>

<p>Wayne muttered something that sounded far
from complimentary, and relapsed into dignified
silence. The white stars came out one by one and
the chill of evening made itself felt. Sam tired of
pretending and begged to be taken up by Wayne,
but Wayne brushed his paws aside. June sat
motionless on his end of the old wheelbarrow and
made no sound. Now, when you haven’t had anything
to eat since early morning and have tramped
miles over city pavements pride is all very well
but it doesn’t butter any parsnips. Besides,
Wayne realised just as clearly as you or I, or
almost as clearly, that he was making a mountain
of a molehill and that if he wasn’t so tired and
discouraged he wouldn’t have hesitated to share
June’s earnings. But pride, even false pride, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
always stubborn, and it was well toward dark
before Wayne shrugged his shoulders impatiently
and jumped up from his seat.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on then, you stubborn mule,” he
muttered. “If you won’t eat without me I reckon
I’ll have to go along.”</p>

<p>He stalked off into the twilight and June and
Sam followed, the former with a little shuffling
caper unseen of Wayne and the latter with an
ecstatic bark.</p>

<p>In the morning, when they had again breakfasted
none too grandly, at the lunch-wagon, they
were once more reduced to penury. Not only that,
but both boys were discovering that forty or fifty
cents a day, while sufficient to keep them from
starvation, was not enough to satisfy two healthy
appetites. Neither made mention of his discovery,
but Wayne, again encouraged by food and
rest, told himself resolutely that today must end
the matter, that he would find something to do
before he returned to the little shed, and June as
resolutely determined to try harder and earn
more money. What Sam’s thoughts were I don’t
know. Sam didn’t seem to care much what happened
so long as he could be with Wayne.</p>

<p>But all the good resolutions in the world and
all the grim determination sometimes fail, and
again Fortune turned a deaf ear to Wayne’s petitions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
The nearest he came to landing a place
was when a foreman at a rambling old factory at
the far end of the town offered him a job packing
spools if he could produce a union card. Wayne
not only couldn’t produce such a thing but didn’t
know what it was until the foreman impatiently
explained, assuring him that there was no use in
his seeking work in the factories unless he first
became a member of a union. This was something
of an exaggeration, as Wayne ultimately learned,
but for the present it was sufficient to just about
double his load of discouragement. He confined
his efforts to shops and places of retail business
after that but had no luck, and returned to the
shed when the street lights began to appear,
hungry and tired and ready to give up, to find
that Fate was not yet through with him for that
day.</p>

<p>For once June had fared almost as sadly as
Wayne and only a solitary ten-cent piece was the
result of his efforts. June was apologetic and
would have recited his experiences at length, but
Wayne didn’t have the heart to listen. “It doesn’t
matter, June,” he said listlessly. “It wasn’t your
fault. At that, you made ten cents more than I
did. I reckon there’s only one thing to do now.”</p>

<p>“What’s that, Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p>“Buy a stamp with two cents of that ten and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
write back to Mr. Higgins for money to get home
with. I reckon we’re just about at the end of the
halter, June.”</p>

<p>“Don’ you believe that, Mas’ Wayne,” replied
June stoutly. “An’ don’ you go writin’ no letter
to that old skinflint stepdaddy of yours. Jus’
you give me another chance an’ see what I goin’
to bring home tomorrow! We’ll go get us a cup
of coffee an’ then we’ll feel a heap perkier, yes,
sir! An’ then we’ll jus’ go to sleep an’ get up in
the mornin’ feelin’ fine an’ start right out an’ lan’
somethin’. Don’ you go gettin’ discouraged, Mas’
Wayne. We’s goin’ to be livin’ on the fat of the
lan’ in two-three days!”</p>

<p>“There’s another town, bigger than this, June,
about twenty miles from here. Maybe we’d better
mosey along over there and see if things are any
better. Seems to me I’ve been in most every
place in this town asking for work now, and I’m
beginning to forget which ones I’ve been to and
which ones I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’ know,” answered June. “Sometimes
it seems like it’s the wisest thing to stay
right to home an’ not go projeckin’ ’roun’. We’s
got a comfor’ble place to sleep here, Mas’ Wayne,
an’ there ain’ no tellin’ what would happen to us
if we went totin’ off to this other place, is there?
’Spose you an’ me goes an’ has that coffee first.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Seems like I can always think a heap better after
meals.”</p>

<p>“A cup of coffee isn’t much of a meal,” objected
Wayne, “but I reckon it’s going to taste
mighty good to me. We’ll go to the lunch-wagon
for it. You get better coffee there than the other
places we’ve been to.”</p>

<p>The lunch-wagon was crowded and they had to
wait for several minutes before they could get
waited on by Mr. Connor. He always seemed glad
to see them and still took a great interest in
Sam, but usually there were too many others
there to allow of much conversation. Tonight he
only nodded and smiled as he passed the cups to
them, and they retired to the side of the wagon
and drank the beverage gratefully, wishing there
was more of it and trying hard to keep their gaze
from the viands displayed beyond the long
counter. Fortunately for Sam, he had already
become acquainted with a number of the regular
patrons of the Golden Star Lunch and was almost
always certain of food. The men who took their
meals there, workers in the nearby factories and
railroad hands, were for the most part rough but
kindly and many crusts of bread and scraps of
meat went to Sam, who, duly grateful and willing
to show his few tricks in return for the favours
bestowed on him, allowed no familiarities. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
anyone other than Wayne or June tried to pat
him he backed away, politely but firmly.</p>

<p>The coffee did the boys good, although it felt
awfully lonesome where they put it, and they returned
to the shed in a more cheerful frame of
mind. It was still too early to go to bed, but the
station was several blocks away and there was
no nearer place to resort to, and so presently they
stretched themselves out on the floor of the shed,
drew the horse blanket over them, and were soon
asleep. How much later it was when Wayne
awoke with a blinding glare of light in his eyes
there was no way of telling.</p>

<p>For a moment he blinked dazedly, his brain still
fogged with sleep. Then he sat up, and Sam,
disturbed, sniffed and broke into shrill barking.
June, a sounder sleeper, still snored when a gruff
voice came from the direction of the light which
Wayne now realised was thrown by a lantern.</p>

<p>“What are you doing in here? Come on now!
Get out!” said the voice.</p>

<p>Wayne scrambled to his feet, commanding Sam
to be still, and June groaned and snorted himself
awake. The light was thrown aside and, framed
in the window, Wayne could see the form of a
policeman.</p>

<p>“We aren’t doing any harm, sir,” said the boy.
“Just sleeping here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sleeping here, eh? Haven’t you got a home?
How many are there of you?”</p>

<p>“Two, sir. We are on our way to New York
and we didn’t have any other place to sleep, so
we came in here.”</p>

<p>“Hoboes, eh? Well, you’d better beat it before
the lieutenant lamps you. He’s down on you
fellows this spring.”</p>

<p>“We aren’t hoboes, sir. We’re looking for
work.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” was the ironical response.
“Well, come on out of it.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t any other place, sir. We
aren’t doing any harm and——”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter about that. What’s your
name and where’d you come from?” Wayne told
him and the officer grunted. Then: “Get the other
fellow up,” he ordered, and, when June had
crawled sleepily to his feet, “Hello, a nig, eh?
Travelling together, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Wayne. “We’re going
to New York, but our money gave out and we’ve
been trying to earn enough to go on with.”</p>

<p>“That straight goods?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it’s the truth, really.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right. Stay where you are tonight,
kids, but you’ll have to get out tomorrow. This is
private property and I can’t have you trespassing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
You’d be welcome to stay as long as you
liked if I had the say, but I haven’t. So don’t let
me find you here tomorrow night or I’ll have to
run you in. Good night, boys.”</p>

<p>The lantern’s glare vanished and the policeman’s
steps went crunching off on the cinders.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<small>WAYNE PARTS WITH SAM</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There was no breakfast the next morning other
than copious draughts of water from the tank in
the station waiting-room. At least, there was
none for the boys; Sam found an ancient crust
of bread along the track and made the most of it.
At a little after eight they parted, agreeing to
meet uptown at noon so that should one or the
other have earned any money they might eat.
Wayne’s ill luck stayed with him and at a little
after twelve he sought the corner near the post
office and found June already on hand. June had
the enormous sum of twenty cents, earned by
carrying a drummer’s sample cases from store
to store for a period of well over an hour, and it
took the boys something less than two minutes to
find a lunch-room and climb to a couple of stools.
Wayne was for conserving half their fortune, but
when June’s eyes rolled covetously at the good
things displayed, and June earnestly assured him
of his ability to earn more money that afternoon,
Wayne recklessly consented to the spending of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
the whole amount. The fact that he was every
bit as hungry as June had a good deal to do with
his change of mind.</p>

<p>That lunch tasted awfully good. Also, as June
remarked wistfully, it tasted “moreish.” But
their money was exhausted and they parted again
at the lunch-room door and went their separate
ways. How many flights of stairs he climbed that
afternoon, how many doors he opened, how many
blocks of hard pavement he trod, Wayne didn’t
know, but even Sam showed evidences of exhaustion
when, at twilight, downhearted and despairing,
boy and dog returned to the shed by the railroad
track.</p>

<p>“I reckon,” Wayne confided, “you and I are
hoodooed, Sam. Reckon there isn’t anything for
us to do but just slink back home the best way we
can, old chap.” And Sam, trotting along beside
him, raised understanding eyes and wagged the
stump of his tail sympathetically.</p>

<p>June was downcast and woe-begone and self-accusing.
Not a cent had he accumulated since
noon. Luck had fairly deserted him. Every offer
of services had been refused and a big, red-faced
man had chased him out of a butcher shop with
upraised cleaver when June had tried to negotiate
for “a little ol’ piece o’ meat.” Hunger again
faced them, and, to make matters worse, they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
homeless. Wayne slumped down on the wheelbarrow
and studied the situation from all angles,
while June kept a sharp and nervous watch for
that troublesome policeman. At length Wayne
arose with a look of settled determination on his
face.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said. “We’ve got to eat, June.
If we don’t we can’t look for work. Mr. Connor
wants Sam and——”</p>

<p>June let out a wail. “You ain’ goin’ to sell
Sam, Mas’ Wayne! Please don’ you do that!
Why, I ain’ hungry scarcely at all yet! Why, I
don’ reckon you got any <em>right</em>——”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to sell him,” interrupted Wayne
impatiently, even indignantly. “I’m going to ask
Mr. Connor to take him and let us have our
meals until we can pay him and get Sam back.
That’s fair, isn’t it? Sam won’t mind—much.
He’ll be warm and have plenty to eat and—and
all.”</p>

<p>“He ain’ goin’ to be happy,” replied June,
shaking his head sorrowfully, “but I reckon he
won’ mind a awful lot if you kind of explains to
him jus’ how it is, Mas’ Wayne. But you reckon
Mister Denny goin’ to do it?”</p>

<p>“I mean to ask him, anyway,” answered Wayne
stoutly. “He can’t do any more than refuse. So
come along before the place fills up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately they found the lunch-wagon empty
save for the presence of Mr. Connor himself and
one tattered individual consuming coffee and
doughnuts at a far end of the counter. Denny was
reading the evening paper under a light beside the
glistening, sizzing coffee urn. “Hello, boys,” he
greeted cordially. “And how’s the world using
you these days? You wasn’t in this morning,
was you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Wayne. “I—could I speak
to you a minute, Mr. Connor?”</p>

<p>“Sure.” Denny laid the paper down and followed
Wayne out of earshot of the lone patron.
“What is it, my boy?”</p>

<p>In a low voice Wayne confided their predicament
and made his proposal. Denny was sympathetic,
and interjected, “I want to know!”,
“Think of that now!”, and similar remarks during
the narrative, and when Wayne had finished
turned instantly and slid two cups and saucers
toward the coffee urn.</p>

<p>“Here,” he exclaimed, “you fellers put this
down before you do any more jabbering. There’s
the sugar forninst you, Junius. What’ll you have
to eat, now? Beef stew, corned beef hash, ham,
eggs——” He ran an eye down the placard on
the wall. “What’ll it be, boys?”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t mind doing it?” asked Wayne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
“I’ll be awfully much obliged to you, Mr. Connor.
I don’t know just when I can pay you back, but
it won’t be very long, I reckon, and——”</p>

<p>“Ah, go on!” replied Denny gruffly. “Eat
what you want. I don’t want your dog, kid!”</p>

<p>But Wayne was firm, even with the fragrant
odour of that coffee in his nostrils, while June,
already on a stool, was rolling longing eyes at the
pies and cakes standing in rows on the shelves.
“If you won’t take Sam for—for security,” said
Wayne earnestly, “I won’t do it, sir. He won’t
be any trouble and he doesn’t eat very much. I
reckon you’d have to keep him tied up for a couple
of days, because he might try to get away and
follow me, but he’d soon get used to you, sir.”</p>

<p>Denny frowned thoughtfully from Wayne to
Sam. “That’s all right,” he said at last, “only
suppose I get fond of him, eh? I got an awful
weak heart for dogs, kid. Look here, I tell you
what. Sam can be security, do you see, and you
can keep him just the same. Then if you don’t
pay up, do you see, I’ll take him. Now what’s it
going to be? That corned beef hash is pretty good
tonight, and if you put a couple of eggs on it——”</p>

<p>“That’s silly,” interrupted Wayne. “Suppose
we left town?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d have to risk that. You wouldn’t,
though. Sure, I know you’re a straight lad.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Wayne shook his head, sighed, and pushed the
untasted coffee away. “Come on, June,” he said
resolutely. “We’ve got to be travelling.”</p>

<p>“Huh?” queried June dismayedly. “Ain’ we
goin’ to eat nothin’?”</p>

<p>“Not here. Mr. Connor doesn’t like our plan,
June.”</p>

<p>“Don’ like it? How come he don’ like it?
Look here, Mister Denny, that Sam dog’s the
smartest, knowin’est dog as is, yes, sir! You can’
make no mistake if you takes him, sir. He’s
got the cutest tricks——”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ve got to take him,” said Denny
ruefully. “But I don’t see why you ain’t satisfied
if I am. Oh, all right. Get on a stool there and
feed your face, kid. You win. What about that
hash now?”</p>

<p>Half an hour later, almost painfully replete
with food and coffee, the boys left the Golden Star
Lunch. Sam, tied with a cord behind the counter,
sent wails of anguish after them, and Wayne hurried
his steps and finally broke into a run. Only
when a corner of a building along the track had
shut off the lugubrious sounds did Wayne slow
down again. After that they traversed a block in
silence. Then it was June who spoke.</p>

<p>“Dogs is awful human folks, ain’ they?” he
asked subduedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Wayne nodded but didn’t answer. Presently,
though, he broke out defiantly with: “We’ve got
to redeem him, June! He isn’t going to be happy
there, Sam isn’t. He—he’s going to be mighty
lonesome.” Then: “So am I,” he added gruffly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I reckon he’s goin’ to be powerful
mis’able at firs’,” agreed June. “We jus’ got to
get to work an’ get him back, ain’t we, Mas’
Wayne?”</p>

<p>“We surely have,” agreed Wayne decidedly.
“And I’m going to find a job tomorrow or—or
bust!”</p>

<p>They stayed in the waiting-room, the object of
deep suspicion on the part of the station policeman,
who, fortunately, was not the officer who had
ordered them away from the little shed, until the
eleven-twelve express had pulled out. Then, when
the baggage-man went through and put out most
of the lights and the ticket seller closed and locked
the door of his office and started for home, they
exchanged the warmth of the waiting-room for
the chill of outdoors and sleepily sought a place
to spend the rest of the night. It wasn’t difficult.
An empty box car on a sidetrack invited them
with a half-opened door and they clambered in,
closed the door behind them, and settled in a
corner, drawing the horse blanket which June
had carried around with him all evening over their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
tired bodies. They lay awake for a good while,
talking, planning, wondering about Sam. At intervals
an engine would roll past with clanking
wheels, sometimes throwing red gleams from the
open door of its fire box through the cracks of
the box car. Later an express thundered by,
shaking the earth. But that was after they had
fallen asleep, and the roar only half awakened
Wayne and disturbed June not a particle.</p>

<p>They awoke late the next morning, stiff-limbed
but rested, and dropped from the car and went
back to the station for a wash-up. Then came
hot coffee and fried eggs and rolls at the lunch-wagon,
but no reunion with Sam, for Denny explained
that he had taken Sam home with him and
that he was at that moment tied to a leg of the
kitchen table.</p>

<p>“He howled a good deal during the night,” said
Denny philosophically, “but I guess he didn’t
keep anyone awake. He seemed a bit easier in
his mind this morning, though, and the missis gave
him a good breakfast and when I left he was licking
the baby’s face. I guess he’s going to be all
right in a day or two, but if the kid gets fond of
him and I get fond of him——” Denny shook
his head. “You haven’t changed your mind about
selling him, have you?”</p>

<p>Wayne said no, and the proprietor of the lunch-wagon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
sighed. “Well, I was only thinking maybe
that would make it a lot easier for all hands. But
I won’t be urging you, kid. He’s a nice little dog
and he sure is fond of you. Any time you want to
see him you go around to the house and tell the
missis who you are, see? No. 28 Grove Street’s
the place. Ring the second bell. Well, so long,
fellers. Good luck!”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was Denny’s wish that influenced
Fortune that day, for when the two met at noon
June proudly displayed two quarters and Wayne
was happy over the possibility of securing work
in a livery stable. “He said I was to come back
in the morning,” explained Wayne as they sought
the little lunch-room that they had patronised the
previous day. “I reckon he means to take me,
June. Wouldn’t that be great?”</p>

<p>“It surely would, Mas’ Wayne. What-all he
want you to do?”</p>

<p>“Drive a carriage, one of the closed carriages
that take passengers from the station. That’s
something I can do, June, drive!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, you surely can drive. But that ain’
scarcely fit work for a gen’leman like you is, Mas’
Wayne.”</p>

<p>“I reckon what you do doesn’t matter much,
June,” replied Wayne. “I reckon you can be a
gentleman and drive a carriage, too. Anyway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
I’d rather be earning some money. Just being a
gentleman doesn’t get you anything as far as
I can see.”</p>

<p>June shook his head at that but didn’t dispute
it. He had something on his mind, and as soon as
they were seated at the lunch-counter he broached
it. “We got to fin’ a place to live, ain’ we, Mas’
Wayne?” he began. Wayne agreed, and June
went on. “Yes, sir. Then let me tell you.” What
he told amounted to this. His search for the illusive
two-bit piece had taken him farther afield
than usual and he had plodded to the outskirts
of the town where there was a stamping works
and a dyehouse and a few other small factories.
His journey had brought him no recompense in
money but he had discovered their future domicile.
It was, he explained, an old street car which
had at some time been pulled out into a meadow
beyond the factories. “I reckon it was a horse
car, like they used to have in Sleepersville, Mas’
Wayne, before the trolleys done come. Mos’ of
the windows is knocked out, but we could easy
board ’em up. An’ one of the doors don’ shut
tight. But it’s got a long seat on both its sides
an’ we could sleep fine on them seats. An’ there’s
a little old stove at one end that someone done left
there, an’ a stovepipe astickin’ out through the
roof. I ask a man at the tin factory an’ he say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
no one ain’ live in it for a long time. An’ there’s
a branch close by it, too; mighty nice tastin’
water, Mas’ Wayne; an’ some trees an’ no one to
ask you no questions, an’ everythin’!”</p>

<p>“That sounds great, June,” said Wayne
eagerly. “How far is it?”</p>

<p>“Must be a good two miles, I reckon. You go
down this away and you bear over yonder-like an’
you follow the railroad right straight till you come
to it.”</p>

<p>“It must be near where we got put off the train
the other night,” said Wayne.</p>

<p>“No, sir, ’tain’, it’s in the other direction; other
side of town.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s right. Well, now look here, June.
We’ve got thirty cents left and that’s enough to
keep us going until tomorrow, and I’m pretty sure
to get that job in the morning. Why don’t we go
out there now and have a look at the place?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, that’s what I was thinkin’. We could
find some boards, maybe, an’ fix up them windows,
an’ get some wood for a fire——”</p>

<p>“We’d better take that blanket out, though, in
case we decided to stay there, June. There
wouldn’t be any use coming back to town, would
there?”</p>

<p>June looked dubious. “How about some supper?”
he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“I forgot that. But, look here, if there’s a
stove there——”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! Get us some coffee an’ bread——”</p>

<p>“And cook our own supper!” concluded Wayne
triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Ain’ that fine? You take this yere money,
Mas’ Wayne, an’ buy them things, an’ I’ll run
back an’ fetch that blanket.” June grinned from
ear to ear, displaying a wealth of glistening white
teeth.</p>

<p>“You’re sure no one owns that car, though,
June? We don’t want to get settled down there
and then be put out the way they put us out of
the little shed.”</p>

<p>“Huh, ain’ no police ever gets aroun’ there, I
reckon,” answered June. “Man said it didn’
belong to no one, too.”</p>

<p>“All right. You get the blanket and I’ll buy
what I can and meet you at the post office in
fifteen minutes or so.”</p>

<p>June disappeared, and Wayne paid the two
cheques and set out to find a grocery store. When
he had completed his purchasing just one lonesome
nickel remained in his pocket, but he had
acquired a modest amount of cheap coffee, five
cents’ worth of butter, a loaf of bread, a can of
condensed milk and some sugar. Five minutes
later they were footing it down the main street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
of Medfield, Wayne bearing the provisions and
June the horse blanket which was a load in itself.
It seemed that June had not underestimated the
distance a particle, nor the difficulties of travel,
for after they had traversed the poorer part of
town their road stopped abruptly and they were
forced to take to the railroad track and, since
trains were coming and going frequently, make
their way along by the little path on the side of
the embankment. Coal yards, lumber yards, a
foundry, vacant lots heaped with cinders and
rubbish, and, at last, the open country, dotted here
and there with small factories which, possibly
because of lower land values, had been set up on
the outskirts of town. June explained that he had
found his way there in the morning by the road,
but that the road was “way over yonder an’ a
heap longer.” Presently he pointed out the
stamping works, or tin factory, as he called it, and
then directed Wayne’s gaze further and to the
right.</p>

<p>“See that bunch of trees, Mas’ Wayne? See
somethin’ jus’ other side of ’em? That’s it, sir!”</p>

<p>“Oh! But it’s a long ways from town, June.”</p>

<p>“It’s a right smart walk, yes, sir, but the rent’s
mighty cheap!” And June chuckled as he led the
way down the embankment, through a fence and
into a boggy meadow. Further away a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
road wound in the direction of the stamping
works, and toward this June proceeded. The road
scarcely deserved the name, but it was drier than
the meadow. It appeared to have been constructed
of a mixture of broken bricks, ashes, and
tin cuttings and the latter glowed in the afternoon
sunlight like bits of gold. They left the road
at the stamping works, through whose open windows
came the hum and clash of machinery,
skirted a huge pile of waste tin, and went on
across the field, choosing their way cautiously
since every low spot held water. By now the
abandoned horse car stood before them in all its
glory of weather-faded yellow paint, broken windows,
rusted roof, and sagging platforms. At one
end some two feet of stovepipe protruded at a
rakish angle from the roof. Wayne looked, saw,
and was dubious. But when June asked proudly,
“What you think of her, Mas’ Wayne?” he only
said, “Fine, June!”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<small>THE NEW HOME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>And when, having slid back the crazy door at the
nearer end of the car, they entered it and seated
themselves on the benches, it didn’t look nearly so
unpromising. There was a good, stout floor underfoot
and a reasonably tight roof overhead.
Wayne began to see possibilities.</p>

<p>The car was only about twelve feet long and of
the usual width. At some time a matched-board
partition had divided it into two compartments,
but this had nearly all disappeared. Every pane
of glass, and there had been eighteen in all, counting
those in the doors, were either smashed or
totally missing. Over one window at each end
and over three of the six windows at each side
boards had been nailed. The remains of a flimsy
curtain hung over the glass of the forward door.
From the roof two lamp fixtures still depended,
but the lamps were gone. The floor was littered
with trash, including newspaper and tin cans and
cracker boxes and scraps of dried bread, indicating
that the place had been used for picnic purposes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
In a corner at the farther end a small
“air-tight” stove was set on a board placed on
the seat. It was badly rusted, the upper door
hung by one hinge, the mica was broken out, and
the interior was filled with ashes and charred
embers. Between stove and ceiling there was no
pipe. Wayne tried the door at that end,
but it was jammed so tightly that he couldn’t
budge it.</p>

<p>An inspection of the outside followed. The
trucks had been discarded and the body of the
car rested on four six-inch sills, two running
lengthwise and two across. An attempt had apparently
been made to set fire to the car, for at
one side the woodwork was scorched and the end
of a sill burned away for nearly a foot. The inscription,
“Medfield Street Railway Co.,” in faded
brown letters against the faded yellow body, was
still legible, as was the figure 6, preceding and
following it.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know what number 1 looks like,”
said Wayne, “if this is number 6!”</p>

<p>Everything of value in the way of metal had
been removed, even to the brass hand rails and
sill plates. The only glass that had escaped
destruction consisted of a number of long and
narrow panes in the roof, of which less than half
remained intact. As Wayne discovered later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
these were set in hinged frames that could be
opened for ventilating purposes. On the front
platform—they designated it the front merely because
it seemed natural to call one front and one
back, and that was the one outside the jammed
door—a dozen sticks of wood suggested the location
of the fuel pile at some time. Ashes had been
disposed of by merely emptying them over the
front dash. June discovered the missing stovepipe
lying a few yards away, but it was so rusted
that it came to pieces when he tried to lift it from
the ground. Other untidy evidences of former occupation
and more recent vandalism lay around:
an iron skillet with the handle broken off, a bent
and twisted toaster, many empty cans, a worn and
sodden rope doormat, a length of rotted clothes
line of which one end was tied to a ten-foot pole
set some six yards away.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” mused Wayne, “who lived here.
And why they went away. And I wonder most
of all, June, how they got this thing out here in
the middle of this marsh.”</p>

<p>But June was ready with a quite feasible explanation,
which was that the car had been loaded
onto a truck and hauled there. “Reckon in the
summer this yere field is all dried up, Mas’
Wayne.”</p>

<p>As it was getting on toward the middle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
afternoon by now it behooved them to set about
preparing the domicile for occupation. They discarded
their coats and set to work and in an hour
had accomplished marvels. The floor was cleared
of rubbish, Wayne requiring June to carry it well
away from the vicinity of the car before disposing
of it, dust was obliterated with the fragment
of curtain, some loose boards were nailed back
into place over the windows—the broken skillet
served as a hammer—the stove door was rehung
with a bent nail, ashes were removed, and the refractory
rear door was coaxed into obedience by
digging away the dirt beneath it with a pocket
knife.</p>

<p>After that the principal demands were stovepipe
and covering for the broken windows. They
thought later of many other things that were
sorely needed, but just now those wants took precedence.
It was out of the question to find stovepipe
nearer than town, unless, as June suggested,
some rubbish dump supplied it, and so they
tackled the matter of covering the windows. For
that they needed boards, or some other material,
and nails. And a hammer would have helped a
lot, although the skillet did fairly well in the
emergency. There was enough of the partition
left to supply boards for one window, but they
had no nails, and a search through the ash pile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
failed to provide more than four bent and rusted
ones. So it was decided that June should walk
back to the stamping works and see if he could
find, beg, or borrow some. Also, he was to be on
the lookout for anything that might be used in
making the new home weather tight. In the meanwhile
Wayne was to “projeck ’roun’,” as June
phrased it, and collect anything useful that could
be found.</p>

<p>June went off, whistling blithely, and Wayne
began his search. The new abode stood about
two hundred yards from the railroad embankment,
at this point a good eight feet above the
meadow, and possibly half again as far from the
nearest building which was the stamping works.
Beyond the latter were a number of other factories,
puffing steam or smoke into the afternoon
sunlight, and beyond these began the town.
Standing on the front porch, which was the term
ultimately applied to the rear platform, the view
to the left ended at the railroad embankment, but
to the right Wayne could see for nearly a mile.
A few scattered houses indicated the dirt road in
that direction and beyond the houses was some
tilled land, and, finally, a fringe of trees. In front
lay the edge of the town, with the town itself,
overhung by a haze of smoke, a good mile beyond.
On the fourth side, visible when Wayne stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
off the “porch” to the soggy ground, the meadow
continued for another hundred yards to a rail
fence. Beyond the fence was a ploughed field
which sloped off and up to meet the blue March
sky. Between car and railroad a group of trees
attracted Wayne’s attention, and he set out for it
across the <em>squishy</em> meadow. Half-way to it he
caught sight of water and recalled June’s mention
of a “branch.” It proved to be a tiny brook that,
emerging from a culvert under the tracks, wandered
as far as the tiny grove and then curved
off to the rail fence and followed it across the
fields in the direction of the road. The water
was clear and cold and tasted very good to
the boy. Just now the brook was overflowing
its bed in places, but the little knoll on which
the cluster of trees grew was high and dry
underfoot.</p>

<p>The brook offered treasure-trove in the shape
of a number of short planks and pieces of boxes
rudely nailed together, doubtless representing the
efforts of some boy to construct a raft. Wayne
doubted its seaworthiness after he had experimentally
pushed it back into the water and tried
his weight on it. He floated it along to the nearest
point to the car, getting his feet thoroughly wet
in the process, and then, not without much panting
and frequent rests, dragged it the balance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the way. After that he ranged the field in all
directions, returning several times with his loads
of wood for fuel or window repairs. He had quite
a respectable pile on the front platform by the
time June returned.</p>

<p>The darkey brought a whole pocketful of nails
and a number of sheets of tin of various sizes
which he had salvaged from the waste heap. Few
were larger than fifteen or sixteen inches in any
direction, but together they would turn the wind
and rain at one window at least. The nails had
been given him by a man in the office. He had,
he said, requested a hammer, too, but the man’s
generosity had balked there. They set to work
with the materials at hand and inside of the next
hour accounted for four windows and part of
a fifth, leaving six still open to the winds of
Heaven. They made a systematic search for
more boards, but failed to find any. Foiled, they
entered their new home and sat down for a brief
rest.</p>

<p>The sight of the groceries presented a new
quandary to Wayne. “Look here, June,” he
exclaimed. “We’ve got coffee and milk and
sugar, and we know where there’s water, but we
haven’t anything to boil it in!”</p>

<p>“My goodness!” said June. “Ain’ that a fac’?
What we-all goin’ to do, Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Wayne shook his head helplessly. “I don’t
know,” he answered. “I reckon that skillet
wouldn’t do, would it?”</p>

<p>It wouldn’t, as an examination proved, for when
the handle had broken off it had taken a generous
piece of the skillet with it. June studied the situation
hard, cupping his chin in his hands and
gazing at the scuffed toes of his shoes. “I
reckon,” he said finally, “we jus’ got to <em>eat</em> that
coffee. ’Sides,” he continued, “how we goin’
to boil it, anyway, without no fire?”</p>

<p>“We could build a fire outside,” answered
Wayne. “For that matter, we could build one in
the stove. I reckon the smoke wouldn’t bother us
much seeing half our windows are open! But
we’ve got to have a coffee-pot or a pan or something.
We surely were chumps, June,” he ended
sadly.</p>

<p>“How come we didn’ think of that, Mas’
Wayne?”</p>

<p>“There’s something else we didn’t think of,”
replied the other. “We didn’t think of anything
to drink it out of, either!”</p>

<p>“I ain’ botherin’ so much about that,” said
June. “Jus’ you cook me that coffee an’ see!
But we surely has got to have somethin’ to——”
He stopped abruptly. “How much money we got,
Mas’ Wayne?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“Five cents. You can’t get a coffee-pot for
five cents, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Give me he,” said June, jumping up. “I’ll go
on back yonder an’ ask that man in the tin factory
to sell me a five-cent kettle or somethin’, Mas’
Wayne. He’s a nice man an’ I reckon when I
tell him we can’ get no supper without he sells
it to us he goin’ do it. Jus’ you wait, Mas’
Wayne.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Wayne. “And ask him to
throw in two tin cups and a candle and a blanket
or two and——”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I ain’ goin’ to ask no imposs’bilities,”
replied June, showing his teeth in a broad
grin, “but I certainly am goin’ to projeck
mightily aroun’ that tin pile. I reckon there’s a
heap more pieces like I done fetched if I can fin’
’em.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’d better go along,” said Wayne,
giving June the nickel.</p>

<p>“No, sir, you stay right here an’ rest yourself,
Mas’ Wayne. I can ’tend to that man without
no help. Jus’ you get them victuals ready——
What’s the matter, Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing,” groaned Wayne, setting down
the paper bag he had untied. “Only I forgot to
ask them to grind the coffee, June!”</p>

<p>“Lawsy-y-y!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>They gazed dejectedly at each other for a
moment. Then June chuckled. “I reckon I’ll
jus’ have to ask that Mister Man to throw
in a coffee grinder, too!” he said. “Ain’
there no way to make coffee out of that, Mas’
Wayne?”</p>

<p>“There must be,” was the answer. “If we can’t
do it any other way, we’ll grind it with our teeth!
You run along and see what you can find, June,
and I’ll try to think up a way of grinding the
coffee.”</p>

<p>So June departed again and Wayne faced his
problem, and when, some twenty minutes later,
the darkey returned in triumph with a tin coffee-pot,
a tin dish, a tin spoon, and several more
sheets of the metal dug from the waste heap
enough coffee for the evening meal was ready
and Wayne was grinding the rest of their supply
between two flat stones! “There’s more than
one way to grind coffee,” he laughed, as June
paused in the doorway to regard the proceeding
in pardonable surprise. “I just remembered the
way the Indians used to grind their corn. Or was
it the Egyptians? Someone, anyhow. I had a
dickens of a time finding these stones, though.
There, that’s the last. It isn’t very fine, but I
guess it will do well enough.”</p>

<p>“Don’ it smell jus’ gran’?” asked June, sniffing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the fragrance. “An’ look what I fetched,
please, Mas’ Wayne. Look yere! Ain’ that a
pretty fine coffee-pot? An’ ain’ that a pretty fine
little dish? An’ look yere at the spoon! All
them for a nickel, Mas’ Wayne! That man certainly
was good to me, yes, sir! I done tell him I
ain’ got but a nickel an’ he say: ‘Nickel’s enough,
nigger. What-all you wantin’?’ He say these
yere things is ‘second,’ whatever he mean, but
I reckon they goin’ to suit us all righty, ain’
they?”</p>

<p>“They’re fine, June! You surely know how to
get your money’s worth. But where are the
blankets I told you to fetch?”</p>

<p>“He goin’ to send them over in the mornin’,”
replied June gravely. “Didn’ have none good
enough, he say. How soon we goin’ to cook that
coffee, Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p>“Not for a long time yet,” said Wayne resolutely.
“We aren’t going to have any supper at
all until all these windows are fixed, June. It’s
getting cold in here already and we’ll just naturally
freeze tonight if we don’t get something over
them. Come on and get to work. Where’s the
tin?”</p>

<p>It was almost twilight when they actually
finished the undertaking. It is doubtful if they
would have finished at all that evening if June<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
hadn’t discovered a piece of tar paper nearly
three yards long and a yard wide near the railroad
embankment. It was torn and held some
holes, but it was far better than nothing and it
covered three windows, with the aid of a few
pieces of wood found in the same locality. Those
windows presented a strange appearance, but
nobody cared about the looks of them. At least,
when the door was closed and the stove was going,
the car was warm enough for comfort even if the
smoke did bring tears to their eyes. Until the
coffee was boiled they kept the fire up, but after
that they were very glad to let it go out.
They had the equivalent of two cups of coffee
apiece and finished most of the bread and butter.
They were very hungry and it was so much easier
to satisfy present appetites than to give thought
to the morrow. The coffee was somewhat muddy,
but, as June said ecstatically, “it certainly did
taste scrumptuous!”</p>

<p>After supper they sat huddled in a corner of
the seat opposite the dying fire and talked. For
some reason their thoughts tonight dwelt largely
with Sleepersville, and Wayne wondered this and
June that, and they decided that at the very first
opportunity Wayne was to write back there and
let his stepfather and June’s mother know that
they were alive and well. And they wondered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
about Sam, too, and how he would like this new
home. And presently they stretched themselves
out on the seat, sharing the horse blanket as best
they could, and slumbered soundly.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>THE LUCK CHANGES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The next day luck turned. Wayne went to work
for Callahan’s Livery Stable, and June, happening
into the Union Hotel with a drummer’s
sample cases, witnessed the discharge of a bell
boy, applied for the position, got it, was thrust
into a dark-blue uniform and, half an hour later,
was climbing stairs and answering calls as though
he had done nothing else all his life. The wage
was only three dollars a week, and out of that he
was required to deposit ten dollars as security for
the uniform, which meant that for three weeks he
would get nothing from his employer. Ordinarily
he would have had to deposit that ten dollars before
starting to work, but the fact that his services
were badly needed at the moment and the fact
that he neither had ten dollars nor could get it,
caused the proprietor to waive the rule. But June
didn’t bother about that ten dollars, for he knew
that it was tips and not wages that counted in his
job, and he believed in his ability to get the tips.
He didn’t return to the new home very rich that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
night, to be sure, for he hadn’t yet learned the
ropes and his chances had been few, but it didn’t
take him long to put his new position on a paying
basis. At the end of three days everyone in the
hotel knew June and liked him. He was always
willing, always ready, and always cheerful. And
he was always polite, a fact which made him a
favourite with the guests, accustomed as they
were to the half-sullen services of the other boys.
Dimes and even quarters dropped into June’s
pocket at a rate that astonished him. When, at
the end of his second week of service, he counted
up his wealth and discovered that it totalled the
stupendous sum of nine dollars and eighty cents
he rolled his eyes and confided to Wayne that he
“didn’ know there was so much money in the
whole world!” The main drawback to June’s
work was that his period of duty began at six
o’clock in the morning and lasted until four in the
afternoon, necessitating a very early rising hour
in the car. Wayne’s own duties didn’t begin until
eight, and in consequence he had two hours on
his hands that he didn’t know what to do with.
Breakfast was always over by half-past five and
a minute or two later June was streaking across
the field to the railroad track. At about twenty-five
minutes to six there was a milk train due and
June had become an adept at swinging himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
a platform as it slowed down at the yard entrance.
Just at first his presence, when discovered, was
resented, but presently the train hands good-naturedly
failed to see him and he rode into town
huddled up on a car step. When, as infrequently
happened, the train was late June was put to it to
reach the hotel on time, but he always did it by
hook or by crook even if he had to run most of the
way over the uneven ties.</p>

<p>Wayne’s job brought him seventy-five cents a
day—when he worked. He didn’t always work, for
it was only when one of the regular men was taken
away to a drive at a funeral or a wedding that his
services were required. But he had to report every
morning, in any case, and it was rather surprising
how many folks were married or buried in Medfield!
He liked driving a carriage well enough, but
waiting for fares at the station in all sorts of
weather wasn’t pleasant. It was a sort of lazy job,
too. On the whole, he was far from satisfied with it
and continually kept his eyes open for something
better. It was rather a blow to his pride to have
June bring home four or five dollars each week
while he almost never earned more than three.
Still, he was thankful for what he got, for it
enabled them to live very comfortably in their
novel home.</p>

<p>One of the first things Wayne did was to recover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Sam. Denny Connor parted with the dog reluctantly,
but consoled himself with the fact that
as Sam had been with him only four days and
hadn’t got used to the change he wouldn’t miss
him as much as he might have.</p>

<p>“You see,” he confided, “it ain’t as if you slept
a lot better for having a dog howl all night in the
kitchen!”</p>

<p>Sam took to the new home at once. He approved
of it enthusiastically. Perhaps the freedom
of the country appealed to him after the
confinement of town. At all events, he had a
perfectly delirious time the first hour, running
around the field, barking at everyone who passed
along the railroad track and searching for rats
under the car. His big adventure came later,
though, when, after disappearing frenziedly and
at full speed into the woods he returned a quarter
of an hour after much chastened and with his
muzzle bleeding profusely from several deep
scratches. What his adversary had been they
never knew. June offered the theory that Sam
had been in mortal combat with a catamount.
I don’t think June knew just what a catamount
was, but he liked the word. Wayne said he
guessed it was a “cat” without the “mount.”
In any event, Sam displayed a strong dislike of
the woods for weeks afterward. Wayne tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
taking him to work with him at first, but Mr.
Callahan objected to having the dog in the carriage
and made Wayne tie him in an empty stall
in the stable. That didn’t please Sam a mite and
he said so very loudly and continuously, so
heartily, in fact, that the edict went forth that
“that fool dog” was not to be brought there
again. After that Wayne shut him up in the car
when he left at half-past seven and was pursued
for a quarter of a mile by Sam’s lamentations.
Eventually the dog learned that he was not to
follow, that his duty was to remain behind and
guard the domicile, and he became reconciled.</p>

<p>“Carhurst,” as Wayne dubbed the new home,
was slowly but steadily rehabilitated. Now that
there was money for the purpose the boys set out
to turn the abandoned horse car into a real place
of residence. Every day witnessed some improvement.
The missing stovepipe was early replaced
with two sections purchased at a junk dealer’s
emporium and with a five-cent can of blacking
June made stove and pipe shine like a new beaver
hat. Red builder’s paper superseded the boards
across the window frames, giving the car quite a
cheerful appearance from without even if it added
little to the lighting within. Sooner or later they
meant to reglaze two windows on each side, and
to that end June brought back a fine big lump of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
putty one afternoon which he had wheedled out
of a painter at work in the hotel. After that, as
Wayne complacently remarked, all they needed
were points, a putty knife, and some glass! They
put shelves up for their groceries, cooking utensils,
and tableware, all largely augmented with returning
prosperity, set a box on the more shaded platform
to serve as an ice-chest, invested in four
blankets and, in short, surrounded themselves
with all sorts of luxuries!</p>

<p>June solved the fuel problem very simply.
Wood soon became scarce and they were forced
to go far afield to find enough to cook meals with,
while having a fire for the mere purpose of keeping
warm on some of those raw nights of early
spring was an extravagance not to be considered.
Not, that is to say, until June had his brilliant
idea. He disappeared one afternoon with the
basket that they used to bring provisions home in
and returned half an hour later bearing it on his
head and filled to the brim with coal. The railroad
tracks were black with it, he reported, and all they
had to do was gather it up. Wayne found that a
slight exaggeration, but it wasn’t at all a difficult
matter to fill a basket without going out of sight
of home. After that, when the weather was cold
or rainy, they kept a fire going all day and night
in the tiny stove, which, in spite of some infirmities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
served them faithfully and cheerfully and
consumed little fuel.</p>

<p>They had a few leaks to contend with when the
rain drove against the car, leaks that simply refused
to be located when the weather was dry and
Wayne, armed with pieces of tin, and tacks, and a
hammer went searching for them. But even more
expensive houses leak, and it was a simple enough
matter to move away from the trickles. To be
sure, it wasn’t so pleasant when they awoke one
very stormy night toward the first of April to
find that the trough-shaped seat upon which they
were reposing had turned itself into a reservoir
for the collection of the rain driving in at a corner
of the car. They had to open the draughts of the
little stove and dry their blankets before they
could go to sleep again on the opposite seat. And
they had difficulties with the windows, too, occasionally,
for the paper had a mean habit of breaking
loose under the combined assaults of wind and
rain. At such times the old horse blanket, now
discarded as an article of bedding, was used as a
temporary shutter. Wayne threatened to varnish
or shellac the paper so that it would turn the rain,
but he never carried out the threat.</p>

<p>June was the cook and a very good one. He
had a positive talent for coffee and could really
do wonders with a frying pan. They never attempted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
ambitious feats of cookery, but they lived
well, if simply, and had all they wanted. Only
breakfast and supper, the latter a rather hearty
meal, were eaten at “Carhurst.” The midday
meal was taken in the town. Wayne went to the
Golden Star Lunch when he had opportunity, at
other times patronising the counter in the station.
June skirmished his lunches in the hotel kitchen,
and, since everyone there from the chef to the
scullery maid liked him, fared well. Sam ate
twice a day to the boys’ knowledge and, it was
suspected, levied toll at noon hour on the employees
of the stamping works. If there hadn’t
been so many chipmunks and squirrels and, possibly,
worthier game to chase he would have
waxed fat and lazy at this period of his history.</p>

<p>They had been living at “Carhurst” something
over three weeks when, quite unexpectedly, almost
overnight, spring arrived. Of course, if they
were to believe the almanac, spring had really
been there some time, but they would never have
suspected it. Some days there had been a mildness
in the air that had seemed to presage the
lady’s appearance, but it wasn’t until they awoke
that April morning to the knowledge that the fire
in the stove, as low as it was, was “super’ogatory”—the
word is June’s, and one he was extremely
fond of—and stuck their heads outdoors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to find out why, that it seemed to them she had
really arrived. It was like May rather than April.
Although it was still only five o’clock in the morning,
there was an unaccustomed warmth in the
air and the east was rosy with the coming sun.
It was after June had scudded off and Wayne had
washed the few breakfast dishes and hung the
dishcloth—yes, they had even attained to the
luxury of a dishcloth by then!—over the platform
rail and had seated himself on the step with Sam
in his arms that the desire that affects almost all
of us on the first warm morning of spring came
to him. He wanted to grow something!</p>

<p>At first glance the prospect of growing anything
at “Carhurst” was not encouraging. The
meadow was still soft and sodden with the spring
rains and here and there little pools of water
showed between the hummocks of turf. But when
one becomes really possessed with the longing to
have a garden it takes a great deal to discourage
one. Wayne set Sam down and walked around
the car and frowned intently over the problem.
After all, he didn’t need a very big patch for his
garden, and by filling in a few low places along
the sunny side of the car and digging out the
turf—turning it under would be better, but it entailed
more labour than he felt capable of that
lazy-feeling morning—he could have a patch about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
four yards long by a yard wide, quite big enough
for his needs. He had no idea of raising such useful
things as vegetables. His soul sighed for
foliage and flowers. He wondered, though, what
kinds of flowers grew up here in the North. He
would, he decided, have to consult someone as to
that. Probably the man he bought his seeds of
would tell him. Anyhow, at the back of the bed,
where it would shade the car in hot weather, he
would have something tall. And in front he
would grow pretty things with lots of colour. He
talked it over all the while with Sam, and Sam indicated
quite plainly that he considered it a perfectly
glorious idea, following Wayne around and
around with his tail never for an instant still.
Finally, Wayne drew forth the little leather bag
in which he kept his money and viewed the contents
doubtfully. Two dollars didn’t seem a great
deal, but it would probably do if only he could
borrow a shovel and rake and not have to buy
them. All the way to town his mind dwelt on the
project and he became so absorbed that he sometimes
forgot to keep on walking and came very
near to being late at the stable.</p>

<p>It was June who solved the problem of shovel
and rake by borrowing both these necessary implements,
as well as a hoe, at the stamping works.
June had many friends there by that time and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
there was no difficulty at all. Wayne bought eight
packages of flower seed—they were far cheaper
than he had dared hope—and one afternoon the
boys began the preparation of the garden. June
was less enthusiastic than Wayne, but he lent
willing assistance. June advocated the growing
of useful things like corn and beans and “tomatuses,”
but acknowledged that the ground at their
disposal was rather too small in area for much
of a crop. Wayne compromised by agreeing to
set out some tomato plants since they were, while
not exactly flowers, attractive when in fruit. The
job was a good deal harder than they had expected,
for that turf had been growing there a
long while and resented being displaced. Sam
tried to help, but his digging was merely spasmodic
and seldom in the right place.</p>

<p>They spent four evenings getting the plot of
ground cleared of grass and graded up, and
Wayne went to bed that fourth evening very tired
but cheered by the anticipation of planting his
garden the next morning. When morning came,
however, a cold east wind was blowing across the
field, the sun was hidden and it seemed as though
Miss Spring must have drawn her flimsy garments
about her and gone shivering back to the Southland.
Instead of planting his seeds, Wayne spent
the time between June’s departure and his own in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
sitting disgustedly in front of the stove and
trying to get warm. He had awakened some time
in the night to find himself uncomfortably chilly,
his cover having fallen to the floor, and he hadn’t
so far succeeded in driving away the little shivers
that coursed up and down his back. He even
sneezed once or twice and sniffed a good deal, and
was sorry when the time came for him to go to
work. He felt strangely disinclined for exertion
and the thought of the walk along the tracks to
town quite dismayed him. But he put his sweater
on and started out and felt better by the time he
had been in the air awhile. The station platform
was a rather exposed place and sitting beside it
on the front seat of a carriage was not a very
grateful occupation today. Wayne sneezed at
intervals and blew his nose between sneezes and
by noon had reached the conclusion that he had a
cold. He wasn’t used to them and resented this
one every time he had to drag his handkerchief
out. There were few arrivals today and Wayne
had little to do. When he took his horse back
to the stable at twelve-thirty for his feed he
climbed into an old hack in a far corner of the
carriage-room and spent an uncomfortable three-quarters
of an hour there. He didn’t want any
lunch, although he had a dim notion that a cup
of hot coffee would taste good. But that meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
exertion, and exertion was something he had no
liking for today.</p>

<p>He was back at the station for the two-twenty-four
and picked up two passengers for the hotel.
He hoped that June would come out for the luggage,
but it was another boy who attended to the
arrivals and Wayne drove off again without seeing
June. It got no warmer as the afternoon
progressed and Wayne was shivering most of
the time. When the five o’clock express was in
and he had satisfied himself that there were no
fares for his conveyance he drove back to the
stable as fast as the horse would trot, unharnessed,
and set out for home. That walk seemed
interminable and he thoroughly envied a gang of
track workers who, having eaten their supper,
were sitting at ease around a stove in an old box
car which had been fitted up for living purposes.
It was all Wayne could do to drag a tired and
aching and shivering body past that stove!</p>

<p>It was almost dusk when he finally crept down
the embankment, squirmed between the wires of
the fence and, with the light from “Carhurst”
guiding him, floundered across the field. June
had a fine fire going in the stove and when Wayne
had pushed the door half open and squeezed
through he simply slumped onto the seat and
closed his eyes, immensely thankful for warmth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and shelter. June viewed him at first with surprise
and then with misgiving.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you, Mas’ Wayne?”
he asked.</p>

<p>Wayne shook his head and muttered: “Just
tired, June.” Then he had a spasm of shivering
and reached for a blanket. June observed him
anxiously for a moment. Then:</p>

<p>“You got a chill, that’s what you got,” he
said decisively. “You lay yourself right down
there an’ I’ll cover you up. My sakes!”</p>

<p>The last exclamation was called forth by a
sudden fit of sneezing that left Wayne weak and
with streaming eyes.</p>

<p>“Lawsy-y-y, child, but you got a cold sure
enough!” said June. “What-all you been doin’,
I like to know? You fix yourself for bed this yere
minute. My goodness, ’tain’ goin’ to do for you
to go an’ get sick, Mas’ Wayne!”</p>

<p>June bustled around and brewed a pot of tea,
a cup of which he insisted on Wayne’s swallowing
while it was still so hot that it almost burned
the latter’s mouth. After that June piled all the
blankets on the invalid and sternly told him to
go to sleep. Rather to Wayne’s surprise, he
found that, as tired and played out as he was,
sleep wouldn’t come. He had aches in queer
places and his head seemed due to burst apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
almost any moment. With half-closed eyes he lay
and watched June cook and eat his supper. Now
and then he dozed for a minute or two. The
warmth from the stove, the hot tea he had drank,
and the piled-on blankets presently had their effect,
and Wayne, muttering remonstrances, tried
to throw off some of the cover. But June was
after him on the instant.</p>

<p>“Keep them blankets over you, Mas’ Wayne,”
he commanded sternly. “You got to sweat that
cold out.”</p>

<p>“I’m hot,” protested Wayne irritably.</p>

<p>“I know you is, an’ you goin’ to be hot! Jus’
you leave them blankets alone an’ go to sleep.”</p>

<p>After a long while Wayne opened his eyes
again. He had been sleeping hours, he thought.
He felt horribly uncomfortable and wondered
what time it was. Then his gaze fell on June
hunched up near the stove with Sam on his knees,
and sighed. If June was still awake it couldn’t
be late, after all. Presently he fell again into a
restless, troubled sleep. In the corner June
nodded, roused himself, looked at the recumbent
form on the seat, reached across and tucked a
corner of a gray blanket in and settled back in
his corner. The firelight, finding its way through
cracks and crevices in the stove, made streaks
and splotches of light on the wall and ceiling, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
one ray fell fairly on June’s face. Perhaps it
was that ray of light that did the business, for
presently his eyelids slowly closed——</p>

<p>Somewhere, afar off, a clock struck three.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>WAYNE LOSES A JOB AND FINDS ONE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Wayne had the grippe, although as neither he
nor June had ever had any experience of that
complaint neither of them named it that. For
four days he was a pretty sick boy, with fever
and aches and inflamed eyes, and June was far
more worried than he allowed the other to see.
June had a mortal fear of “pneumony,” and there
was scarcely an hour when he was at home when
Wayne wasn’t required to assure him that his
chest wasn’t sore and that it didn’t hurt him to
breathe. Two of the four nights June got almost
no sleep, only dozing for a few minutes at a time
as he sat huddled in the corner by the stove.
The first day of the illness he stayed at home,
after walking to the nearest telephone and explaining
his absence from duty to the Union Hotel.
After that he took himself off each morning only
because Wayne insisted, and was far from happy
until he had got back again. He invested in three
different varieties of patent medicine and administered
them alternately in heroic doses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
one of Wayne’s chief interests was the attempt
to decide which of the three was the nastiest. It
was a difficult question to decide, for the last one
taken always seemed the worst. June also attempted
the concoction of some “yarb tea” such
as he had so often seen his mother make, but
while it smelled the place up in a most satisfactory
manner, June was never quite certain that it contained
all it should have, and distrusted it accordingly.
There was one day, the second of the
attack, when Wayne was in such agony with an
aching head and body that June was all for finding
a doctor and haling him posthaste to “Carhurst.”
Wayne, however, refused to listen to
the plan, declaring that he would be all right
tomorrow. “Besides,” he added weakly, “you
couldn’t get a doctor to come away out here,
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Say I couldn’? Reckon if I tell a doctor man
I got to have him and show him the money right
in my fist, he goin’ to come where I say!” declared
June sturdily. “Jus’ you let me fetch one, please,
sir, Mas’ Wayne.”</p>

<p>But Wayne insisted on waiting a little longer,
and June rubbed the lame and achy spots and
doubled the doses and, sure enough, after a most
wretched night, Wayne felt better in the morning.
The nights were always the worst, for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
while he slept for an hour now and then during
the day, at night he was always wakeful. Illness
always seems worse at night, anyway, and there
was no exception in Wayne’s case. Poor June
was driven nearly to his wits’ end some nights.
Wayne was not, I fear, a very patient patient.
He had never been as sick before in all his life
and he resented it now forcibly and seemed inclined
to hold June in some way accountable for
it. But that was only when he had really begun
to get better, and June was so thankful for his
recovery that he bore the other’s crankiness quite
cheerfully.</p>

<p>All things come to an end, and one day—it happened
to be a Sunday—Wayne got up for the first
time and ate some real food. June had been trying
to entice him with soup and gruel and similar
things which Wayne unkindly termed “hog-wash”
for two days with little success, but today Wayne
consumed a lamb chop and two slices of toast and
a cup of tea with gusto. And after it he went to
sleep again and awoke in the afternoon quite himself,
save for an astonishing wabbliness in his
legs. The next day he was out on the “front
porch” in the warm sunlight when June departed
to town, and still later he walked around some, to
Sam’s vociferous delight, and cooked some lunch
for himself and discovered a returning interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
in the garden. And the next day he reported to
Mr. Callahan for work again and was curtly informed
that his place had been given to someone
else.</p>

<p>As June had visited the stable and told the
liveryman of Wayne’s illness as soon as it became
evident that the latter couldn’t go to work, and
as Mr. Callahan had given June to understand
that the position would be kept open, Wayne was
too astounded to even make a reply, and it wasn’t
until he was a full block away that it occurred
to him to be either indignant or disappointed.
And then, as neither indignation nor disappointment
promised any relief, he tried his best to
swallow them and put his mind on the problem of
finding other work. There was another livery
stable in town that he knew of, and there might
be still more that he didn’t know of, and, while
driving a carriage wasn’t at all his idea of a
satisfactory occupation, it brought money to his
pocket and enabled him to live, and whereas he
had not been particularly interested in living four
days ago, today he was convinced that it was not
only desirable but delightful. There is at least
this to be said for an illness: after it is through
with you it leaves you with a greater appreciation
of life.</p>

<p>Wayne visited the stable he knew of but received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
no encouragement. The foreman told him
that they had all the men they needed and that
they didn’t expect to have a vacancy in the near
future. He directed Wayne to another livery,
however, at the farther side of town, and Wayne
set off. His course took him over the railroad
about a block beyond the freight sheds. It was
nearly nine by then and the scene about him was
a very busy one. Cars were loading and unloading
beside the long, high platforms, while, on the
other side of the sheds, trucks and drays were
coming and going along the cobbled street. A
switch engine was tooting frantically for a switch
and a long train of day coaches and sleepers sent
Wayne scurrying out of the way. Then an impatient
engine clanged up with a couple of
gondolas laden with machinery and contemptuously
jerked them onto a side-track, spurting off
again as though vastly relieved to be rid of such
trifling company. There were many tracks where
Wayne crossed and one had to keep one’s eyes
opened. When he was half-way over a pounding
of the rails caused him to look down the line. A
long train of empty box cars was backing toward
him at a brisk speed, the locomotive out of sight
at the far end. Wayne hurried his pace and
reached an empty track in plenty of time, and
was for paying no more heed to the string of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
empties until a shout behind him brought his
head quickly around.</p>

<p>On the roof of the first car a man was doing
two things at once. He was yelling at the top of
his voice and swinging himself over the end of the
car to the ladder there as fast as he could. A
few yards distant, squarely in the middle of the
track, stood a boy of five or six years. Afterward
Wayne wondered where he had come from,
for surely he had not been in sight a moment
before, but just now there was no time for speculation.
The child, terrorised into immobility,
stood as though rooted to the cinders between the
rails. <a href="#image02">Wayne’s cry was uttered involuntarily
as he leaped forward.</a> Only one line of track
separated him from the boy, but it seemed impossible
for him to reach the latter before the bumper
of the box car struck him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 457px;">

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_105">Wayne’s Cry Was Uttered Involuntarily as he Leaped
Forward</a></div>
</div>

<p>As Wayne dashed forward with a horrified, sickening
fear at his heart the brakeman dropped
from the car ladder. But he staggered as his feet
touched the ground, and had the boy’s safety depended
on him he would never have escaped. It
was Wayne who caught him up roughly and half
lifted, half dragged him across the further rail
to safety just as the end of the car swept over
the spot on which he had stood. So close was the
escape that the corner of the car struck Wayne’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
hip and sent him reeling to fall on his knees
against the end of the ties of the next track, the
child sprawled beside him. Dazed, breathless,
Wayne struggled to his feet, pulling the lad up
with him. Twenty feet distant a switch engine
had stopped with grinding brakes, and engineer
and fireman were running toward him. The train
of empty box cars rolled stolidly on, but in a moment
began to slow down with much bumping and
clatter of couplings, while back along the roofs
sped the brakeman whose warning shout had
alarmed Wayne. Just what happened during the
next few minutes Wayne couldn’t recall afterward.
The lad, his face crushed to Wayne’s
worn coat, was sobbing hysterically. The engineer
and fireman were there, and presently the
brakeman dropped down beside them, and after
that other men appeared as though by magic.
Everyone talked at once and it was all very confused.
Someone took the boy from Wayne and
lifted him in arms and someone else propelled
Wayne across toward the freight house. About
that time the talk around him began to register
itself on his brain.</p>

<p>“’Tis Jim Mason’s kid,” said one. “’Twould
have broke his heart entirely had the lad been
hurted!”</p>

<p>“Hurted!” scoffed another. “Sure, ’tis dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
he’d be this minute save for this la-ad here!
’Twas a close shave at that, I’m telling you.
Faith, I shut my eyes, I did so!” It was either
the engineer or the fireman speaking. “Are you
hurted, me boy?” This was to Wayne, and Wayne
shook his head silently. “Your hands be cut a
bit, but they’ll soon mend.”</p>

<p>“You’d better wash the dirt out,” advised
another as they climbed the steps at the end of
the platform. “I’ve known lockjaw to come from
less, and——”</p>

<p>But just then they entered the dim twilight of
the shed and Wayne, pushed ahead by his good-natured
captors, lost the rest of the cheerful remark.
Someone shouted for “Jim! Jim Mason!”
and an answering hail came from further down
the shed and a big man advanced toward them,
illumined for a moment as he passed one of the
wide, sunlit doorways.</p>

<p>“What’s wanted?” he shouted.</p>

<p>“’Tis your kid, Jim,” was the reply. “Nearly
run over he was a minute back. All right, laddie,
here’s your father comin’. Hush your cryin’
now.”</p>

<p>“<em>Terry!</em>” The big man’s voice held wonder
and alarm and joy. He sprang across the intervening
space and seized the child from the arms
that held him. “Terry! Are you hurt, darling?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
What were you doing on the tracks? Don’t cry,
son, it’s over now.” He turned questioningly to
the sympathetic faces about him, faces that were
grinning only because tears were so near the
eyes. “How did it happen, fellows? Who saw
it?”</p>

<p>“Him and me,” answered one man, “and Larry
there. Larry was riding the roof on a string of
empties when he seen the boy on the track——”</p>

<p>“Holy Saints, but I was scared stiff!” broke
in the brakeman. “I gave a shout and tried to
get down the ladder, but when I jumped I hit
the end of a tie, Jim, and it was this fellow——”</p>

<p>“Grabbed him up in the nick o’ time,” went on
another. “I seen it from the cab window. There
wasn’t the width of an eyelash between the car
and the child when he got him. Sure, even then
I thought it was good night to the pair of them.
The car hit the fellow as he jumped and——”</p>

<p>“So ’twas you?” said Jim Mason in his big,
deep voice. “’Twas brave of you, sir, and God
bless you for it.” He had the child on one big
arm now and stretched his free hand toward
Wayne. “I guess I don’t need to say I’m thankful
to you. You know that, sir. I think a deal of
this little kiddie, and as for his mother——” His
voice trembled. “Heaven only knows what she
would do if anything happened to him! She’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
thank you better than I can, but if there’s anything
Jim Mason can do for you, why, you say it!”</p>

<p>“It was nothing,” stammered Wayne. “I’m
glad that—that I was there, and that I—was in
time, sir.”</p>

<p>“God be praised and so am I!” said the father
fervently. “Hush your crying now, Terry. It’s
your father that’s got you. Can you thank the
brave lad for saving you?”</p>

<p>But Terry couldn’t. Terry was as yet incapable
of anything but sobs. Wayne, wanting to go,
scarcely knew how. Mechanically he raised a
bruised knuckle to his lips and Jim Mason was
all solicitude.</p>

<p>“You’ve cut your fist!” he exclaimed. “Come
to the office with me till I fix it up for you.
There’s dirt in it, likely. Larry, I’m thanking
you, too, for what you did,” he added, turning to
the brakeman. “I’ll not forget it.”</p>

<p>“Sure, I did nothing,” laughed the brakeman
embarrassedly, “only yell!”</p>

<p>“It was his shout that drew my attention,”
said Wayne. “He tried hard to get to him.”</p>

<p>“What matter now?” muttered the brakeman.
“’Tis all over, and ’twas you was Johnny-on-the-Spot,
feller. ’Twas finely done, too, and no mistake!
I take my hat off to you for a fine, quick-thinkin’
and quick-doin’ laddie!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, I know you now!” said Jim Mason at
that moment. “I was thinking all the time I’d
seen you before. You’re the kid—I mean the
young gentleman—that spoke me one morning a
couple of weeks ago. You had a nigger boy with
you, and a dog. Ain’t I right?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Mason, but it was more than two
weeks ago,” answered Wayne. “I—I’m glad to
see you again.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you’re glad, what about me?” bellowed
Jim Mason. “Thank you all, fellows. I’ll
mend this gentleman’s hand now. Will you come
with me, please?”</p>

<p>Wayne followed the man to the farther end of
the freight house where, occupying a corner that
afforded a view down the long stretch of shining
tracks, there was a cubby-hole of an office. A
high desk, a correspondingly tall stool, a battered
armchair, a straight-backed chair, a stove,
and a small table made up the furnishings. The
walls held many hooks on which were impaled
various documents, a shelf filled with filing-cases,
several highly-coloured calendars, a number of
pictures cut from magazines and newspapers, and,
over one of the two dusty-paned windows, a yard-long
framed photograph of “The Lake-to-Coast
Limited.” In spite of dust and confusion, a
confusion which as Wayne later discovered was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
more apparent than real, the little office had a
cosy, comfortable air, and the sunlight, flooding
through the front window, made even the dust-motes
glorious.</p>

<p>Jim Mason set the child in a chair, produced a
first-aid kit from some place of concealment, and
proceeded to repair the damages wrought by the
cinders. There was running water outside, and
the wounds, none of them more than surface
scratches, were first thoroughly cleaned. Then
peroxide was liberally applied, the man grunting
with satisfaction when the stuff bubbled. Finally
surgeon’s tape was put on, and Wayne was discharged.
During his administrations Jim Mason
asked questions at the rate of a dozen a minute,
and soon had Wayne’s history down to date.
The liveryman’s callousness wrought him to
gruff indignation.</p>

<p>“Fired you because you was sick, did he, the
pup? What do you know about that? Sit down
and rest yourself, lad.” He perched himself on
the stool and became busy with a pile of waybills
on the desk, talking as he worked. “And so
you’re out of a job again, are you? I suppose a
smart lad like you can figure and write a good
fist, maybe?”</p>

<p>“I can figure,” replied Wayne, “but I don’t
believe my writing’s much to boast of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here, put your name and your address on
that.” Jim pushed a slip of paper to the end of
the desk and dipped a pen in ink.</p>

<p>Wayne wrote and handed the result back.
“‘Wayne Torrence Sloan,’” read Jim, “‘Carhurst,
Medfield, Pennsylvania.’ That’s not so
bad. But what might ‘Carhurst’ mean?”</p>

<p>Wayne explained and the man chuckled. “It’s
a fine-sounding name all right,” he said. “How’d
you like a job here with me, Sloan? I been looking
for a feller for a week. There’s a guy up to
Springdale that wants the place, and he’s coming
down this afternoon to see me, but—I don’t
know.” Jim looked out the window and whistled
a tune thoughtfully. “He mightn’t do at all,”
he went on after a moment, “and if you say you
want to try it——”</p>

<p>“I do!” said Wayne promptly. “That is, if
you think I could.”</p>

<p>Jim turned and looked him over appraisingly.
“I don’t see why not. If you can figure and
write a bit and do as I tell you, you’d have no
trouble. And you look like a strong, healthy lad,
although your face is sort of pale. That comes of
being sick, I guess. ’Tain’t all office work, for
you’ll have to be out in the yard a good deal.
You’d be here at eight in the morning—I’m here
long before, but you wouldn’t need to be—and get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
off at five, with an hour for dinner. The pay ain’t
much, only eight dollars, but if you got on there
might be something better; maybe a place in the
main office. Want to try it?”</p>

<p>“Very much,” said Wayne.</p>

<p>“All right then. Maybe I can head that feller
at Springdale off and save him a trip.” He drew
a telegram blank from a pigeonhole and wrote
slowly and laboriously. “Maybe I’m taking a
chance, lad, for I don’t know much about you,
do you see, and you haven’t any references, but
a feller that shows pluck like you did awhile ago
can’t have much wrong with him, I’m thinking.
There, I’ll put this on the wire. Be around at
eight sharp in the morning, lad, and I’ll put you
to work. Better come a bit before eight, though,
so’s I can tell you what’s wanted before the rush
starts. Got any money?”</p>

<p>“A little, sir.”</p>

<p>“Get yourself a suit of overalls; black like
these. You’ll need ’em likely. Now I got to do
something with this kid.” Jim turned and observed
his offspring frowningly. Terry had at
last stopped sobbing and was watching interestedly
through the front window the operation
of unloading a car. “How he came to be wandering
about here I dunno. And maybe his mother’s
worrying about him this minute. He ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to be home, but I don’t see how I can get him
there.”</p>

<p>“Let me take him home,” offered Wayne
eagerly. “Just tell me where the house is, Mr.
Mason.”</p>

<p>The man’s face lightened. “Will you do it?”
he exclaimed. “That’s fine, then. Will you go
with the nice gentleman, Terry?”</p>

<p>Terry looked doubtful, but when Wayne smiled
down at him he nodded shyly and summoned a
smile in return.</p>

<p>“I live on Monmouth Street,” said Jim. “’Tis
the fourth house from the corner of Railroad Avenue,
the one with the sun-parlor on it.” There
was pride in his voice when he mentioned the sun-parlor
and Wayne was quite certain that it was
the only sun-parlor on Monmouth Street. “Ask
for Mrs. Mason and just tell her the kid was down
to see me and I sent him home by you. Don’t
tell her about what happened, lad. She’d be tied
up in a knot. I’ll give her the story when I get
home. Maybe you’d better go around to the back,
for I dunno would she hear you knock, being busy
in the kitchen likely. Do you want the nice gentleman
to carry you, Terry, or will you walk along
like a little man, eh?”</p>

<p>“Want to be carried,” said Terry promptly.
“I’m tired, daddy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Tis a blessing you ain’t worse than tired,
kiddie,” said his father feelingly. “How came
it you were down here all alone, Terry?”</p>

<p>Terry studied his shoes intently for a moment.
At last: “Wanted to see choo-choos,” he
answered.</p>

<p>“Listen to me, Terry. Don’t you ever come
around the choo-choos again without somebody’s
with you. If you ever do I’ll whale you, kid.
Remember that. Now go along with the gentleman
and be a good boy.”</p>

<p>Wayne carried Terry until they were across
the tracks and then the child demanded to be set
down. “You don’t carry Terry like daddy does,”
he complained. “Want to walk?” So they went
the rest of the way hand in hand, Terry, now most
communicative, talking incessantly. Wayne had
a very hazy idea as to the location of Monmouth
Street and Terry’s directions were difficult to
follow, so he had to ask his way several times.
But he found the house eventually, easily identifying
it by the sun-parlor which stood out at one
end of a tiny front porch like a sore thumb. Mrs.
Mason proved to be a comely, smiling-faced
woman apparently some years Jim’s senior.
Terry, she explained, as she wiped her hands on
her apron in the back doorway, had been turned
out to play in the yard, and he was a bad boy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
run away like that. “You might have been
killed,” she told the child severely, “and the Lord
only knows why you wasn’t. Thank you, sir, for
bringin’ him back, and I hope he was no trouble
to you.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit, Mrs. Mason. He behaved beautifully.
Good-bye, Terry. Be a good boy now and don’t
run off again.”</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” answered Terry, politely but indifferently.
“I got a hen, I have, an’ she’s going
to have a lot of little chickens pretty soon. Want
to see her?”</p>

<p>“Not today, Terry, thanks,” laughed Wayne.
“Maybe I’ll come and see her after the chickens
are hatched.”</p>

<p>“All right. Mama, can I have some bread and
sugar?”</p>

<p>Wayne left while that question was being debated
and hurried off uptown, first to tell June
the wonderful news and then to purchase that
black jumper. There was a new quality in the
April sunshine now and Wayne discovered for
the first time that Medfield was an attractive
place after all. The folks he passed on the street
looked friendly, the clanging of the trolley car
gongs fell pleasantly on his ear; in short, the world
had quite changed since early morning and was
now a cheerful, hopeful place, filled with sunshine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and bustle and ambition. Wayne’s spirits soared
like the billowing white clouds of steam above
the buildings and he whistled a gay little tune as
he went along.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

</div>


<p>He spent the afternoon, after his return to “Carhurst,”
in planting his garden and had the seeds
all in by the time June came. He displayed the
result proudly. Every row was marked with a
little stick on which was perched the empty seed
packet like a white nightcap. June admired flatteringly
and then, for so it always happens,
criticised.</p>

<p>“Seems to me like you ought to put them rows
’tother way roun’, Mas’ Wayne, ’cause the sun
goin’ to shine this yere way. Back home they
always set the rows with the sun.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, June,” acknowledged Wayne. “I
forgot that.” But he was in far too fine spirits
to be worried by a little thing like that. He said
he reckoned they’d grow just the same, and June
agreed with him, but a trifle doubtfully. Then
June questioned whether the planting had been
done at the right time of the moon, and Wayne
lost patience and told him to get busy and help
carry stones for a border. They had to fairly dig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
for those stones and it was almost twilight by the
time they had the bed neatly edged. Then June
washed up and set about his culinary duties, leaving
Wayne outside to admire his handiwork
from various angles and try to picture mentally
the appearance of that bed three months
later.</p>

<p>Wayne had brought home a slice of ham as a
special delicacy and June fried it to a turn, after
cutting it in three pieces to fit the diminutive
pan, and made coffee, and cut bread, and opened
a can of peaches, and, in brief, prepared a banquet
fit for Luculus—or two very healthy and hungry
boys, one of whom had been on short rations for
a week! Afterward, by the light of a swinging
lantern which had taken the place of the candles
with which they had at first tried to illumine their
abode, Wayne read from the newspapers that
June picked up at the hotel and brought home
with him. June had a weakness for such things
as robberies, murders, fires, shipwrecks, and similar
sensations, while Wayne always looked for the
baseball news first. So, to be quite fair, he alternated,
reading first, perhaps, the story of a Texas
bank robbery and following with an interesting
rumour regarding the trade of Catcher Moffet
to the Pirates by the Braves. Toward the last of
the news budget, especially if the robberies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
train wrecks and such gave out, June usually
fell asleep and snored unflatteringly, and Wayne
finished his perusal in silence. But tonight the
latter early exhausted the papers and the boys
fell to a discussion of Wayne’s new job and to
laying plans for the future.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Wayne, “if I get eight dollars
a week it won’t be long before we can go on to
New York.” He made the observation without
apparent enthusiasm, however. For the past
fortnight New York had slipped out of their conversation.
June nodded, opened his mouth, closed
it again without speaking and once more nodded.
“It doesn’t cost us more than three dollars a
week to live and so we’d have twenty dollars saved
up in no time at all,” Wayne added.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed the other. “Reckon New
York’s a mighty fine city, ain’ it?”</p>

<p>“Wonderful, June.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh. Bigger’n Medfield consid’able?”</p>

<p>“Medfield! Why, New York’s a thousand times
bigger than Medfield, you silly!”</p>

<p>“Say it is?” June digested that in silence for
a moment. Then: “Must be a powerful big ol’
place, Mas’ Wayne,” he said dolorously. “Ain’
you afraid we’d get lost or somethin’. There was
a feller I know got lost in Atlanta one time an’
he didn’ find hisself for days an’ days, no sir!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
An’ I ’spects New York’s a heap bigger’n Atlanta,
ain’ it?”</p>

<p>“Lots bigger. Atlanta’s just a village compared
to New York.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh.” June remained silent this time for
many minutes, and Wayne too seemed engrossed
in thought. Finally, though, June said: “Mas’
Wayne, what we-all got to go to New York for,
sir? Why don’t we stay jus’ where we is? We’s
both of us got jobs here, an’ goodness only knows
what’s goin’ to happen to us in that big ol’ place!
Why don’t we stay put, Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered the other slowly, “we started
for New York, June, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, we surely done started for it, but we
don’t have to get where we started for, does we?
Ol’ Eph Jennings, he started for the circus one
day but he fotched up in the calaboose, Mas’
Wayne. Startin’ an’ stoppin’s mighty different
things, I reckon. Let’s us stay right here a little
while longer, please, sir.”</p>

<p>“All right, June. I—I guess I’d rather, anyway,”
answered Wayne.</p>

<p>The next morning he started at his new work,
rather doubtful as to his ability to perform it
satisfactorily but determined to try his very
hardest. There were two reasons for that, one
the necessity of earning money and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a strong desire to please Jim Mason and prove
that he had made no mistake in his choice of a
helper. By evening of that first day, however,
Wayne knew that the work was not beyond him,
and he went home at dusk happy in the knowledge.
Perhaps someone who had the interests of the
boy less at heart might have made that first day
in the freight house far from simple for him,
for, of course, the duties were new and strange,
but Jim was patient and explained everything
clearly and in detail. Wayne found that his
mathematical ability was more than enough to
cope with such simple problems as fell to him.
Most of that morning was occupied in filing away
an accumulation of papers that had got far ahead
of Jim during the time he had had no assistant.
There were waybills to check after that, and once
Wayne had to go up and down the yard on a vain
search for a mislaid flat car loaded with two tractor
engines. Jim, relieved of much of the clerical
work, was busy outside most of the day, but he
and Wayne ate their lunches together in the little
office, Jim sharing the can of coffee he had brought.</p>

<p>As the days went on Wayne’s tasks multiplied.
He went errands to the main office down the track
a block, he tacked waycards to freight cars, became
an adept with lead seals and pincers, learned
how to coax open a door that had “frozen,” became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
friends with most of the workers and truckmen—not
a difficult task since the story of his
timely rescue of little Terry Mason had gone the
rounds and even got in the <cite>Medfield Evening Star</cite>,
although Wayne didn’t learn of that until later
and never read the account of his heroism—and
got on very famously for a new hand. And he
liked his work, which is always half the battle.
Jim began to trust him with bigger things when
he had been there a fortnight, and Wayne proved
worthy of the trust. Perhaps the things weren’t
so vastly important, after all, but they seemed so
to Wayne; to Jim, too, for that matter, for Jim
was extremely conscientious and took his work
seriously. After a few days Wayne got to walking
across the tracks and up the line a ways to the
Golden Star Lunch. He was always sure of a
welcome there, and sometimes, when the wagon
wasn’t very full, he and “Mister Denny” had
long and serious conversations on a variety of
subjects. Denny had a fair education, was an
omnivorous reader, a good listener and held views
of his own. Moreover, he could put his views
into words. They were sometimes unusual, but
Wayne had a feeling that it was a heap better to
have opinions and be able to state them, even if
they were queer, than to merely agree with everyone
else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>There was one subject that never failed them as
a conversational topic, and that was baseball.
Denny was a “thirty-third degree fan” if ever
there was one. Besides that he had some practical
knowledge of the game, for he had played it
from the time he was four feet high until he had
bought the lunch-wagon and set up in business.
Wayne’s command of baseball history and percentages
was nothing like Denny’s, but he followed
the news closely and there were some rare
discussions at times in the Golden Star. Many of
the freight handlers and truck drivers patronised
Denny’s café and Wayne was surprised to find
how much they knew of the national pastime and
how intelligently they could talk of it. Quite
frequently the lunch-wagon shook with the ardour
of debate, for there were deep and hearty voices
in the company. But a time shortly came when
Wayne didn’t loiter in the Golden Star after his
lunch was eaten, for he had found by then a better
way to spend the remaining time.</p>

<p>He had been in the freight house about a fortnight
and May had come to the world, bringing
ardent sunshine and soft breezes. Green leaves
were unfolding and the meadows were verdant.
It was sometimes a task in those first warm days
to move, and the trucks that rolled incessantly
from cars to platform and from platform to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
freight house moved more slowly. One noontime
Wayne felt too languorous to walk even as far as
Denny’s, and so he bought two sandwiches and
some apples from a man who came around with a
basket and joined the throng on the shaded platform
where the trucks stood. After a while one of
the younger fellows pulled a baseball from his
pocket and soon a half-dozen were throwing and
catching in the wide cobble-paved road behind the
sheds. Wayne watched lazily and interestedly
until a wild throw sent the ball rolling under a
truck to his feet. He jumped down and rescued
it and threw it back, choosing the man farthest
distant and speeding the ball to him so hard and
true that shouts of commendation rewarded him.</p>

<p>“Come on out here, kid, and take a hand,”
called one of the players, and Wayne, glad enough
to do it, responded, forgetting that a quarter of
an hour ago he had felt too lazy to walk two
blocks. There was lots of fun to be had, for many
of the players, Wayne amongst them, had not
handled a ball since the summer before and the
“hot ones” made them wince and yell, something
that always brought laughter from the rest. Soon
a dozen or so were at it and the ball passed from
one to another, up and down the road. Occasionally
a fly would go up and a mad scramble ensue
in which hats fell off and the ball, as like as not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
escaped them all. Wayne thoroughly enjoyed
that half-hour and resolved to buy a baseball
on his way home so that he and June could
pass.</p>

<p>A few days later someone produced a bran-new
bat and the fun increased. At the end of a
week or so they were playing “scrub” every noon-hour,
and by common consent the truckmen left
their vehicles at the far end of the platform so
that there would be more room for playing. Even
so the diamond was pretty narrow and the distance
from first base to third was ludicrously
short. A ball hit to right or left performed
strange antics, bounding from wall or platform
and landing almost anywhere in infield or out.
Freight handlers, truckmen, clerks from the main
office, switchmen, even “Big Tom” Maynard, who
ran the Limited and laid over in Medfield twice
a week, took part. And there was a slim, good-looking
youth named Pattern who worked in the
office of the coal company several blocks away and
who could pitch a ball so that you couldn’t see it
until it had passed you. With the exception of
Pattern and possibly a truckman named Donovan,
who had once played semi-professional ball on
some team in New Jersey, Wayne was the star of
the gatherings. He never failed of a hit save
when Pattern was in the points, and even then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
was the only one who could come near to meeting
that youth’s offerings, and fielded remarkably.
So, at least, the less adept considered. “Big
Tom,” who by virtue of having the best run on the
road was accorded unusual respect, told Wayne
he was wasting his time. It was a noon when
a sudden shower had driven them to the shelter
of the overhang.</p>

<p>“If I had a wing like you’ve got, kid, I’d be
training for the Big League. I surely would.
You’re a natural-born ball player, son. I know
a fellow up in Lebanon who’ll be glad to give you
a try-out if you say the word.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I’d better stick to what I’m sure of,”
laughed Wayne. “I reckon I wouldn’t last very
long up there.”</p>

<p>“Sure you would,” said Big Tom earnestly.
“And look at the money you’d be getting! They
wouldn’t pay you a cent under twenty dollars,
kid!”</p>

<p>“But I’m getting thirty-five here, Mr. Maynard.”</p>

<p>“You’re what? Thirty-five a week?”</p>

<p>“No,” stammered Wayne, “thirty-five a
month.”</p>

<p>“What you talking about then? Twenty a
week’s what they’d pay you up in Lebanon.
Maybe a lot more. Tell you what I’ll do, kid;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
I’ll tell this fellow about you the next time I
see him, eh?”</p>

<p>But Wayne shook his head. “Thanks, but I
reckon I’ll stick here,” he answered.</p>

<p>Big Tom told him he was making a mistake and
appealed for confirmation to Pattern who had
joined them. Pattern laughed. “Twenty dollars,
you say? What sort of a team is it, Maynard?”</p>

<p>“It’s a corking good team, that’s what
sort——”</p>

<p>“I mean is it professional? Or semi or what?”</p>

<p>“Why, I guess it’s a professional team. Sure
it is. They play in the Central City League.”</p>

<p>“I see. Well, I’d advise this fellow to keep
out of it then. He’d be wasting his time with a
bunch of pikers like that.” Pattern turned from
Big Tom’s indignant countenance to Wayne.
“When you think you’d like to play ball for a
living, you tackle the manager of a real team.
Tell him you want a try-out. He will give it to
you if he’s any good. If he isn’t you don’t want
to join him. These two-by-twice ball teams don’t
get you anything but a lot of hard work and you
can stay in one of them until you’re gray-headed
without doing any better for yourself. I played
with one of them one summer and I know something
about them. When you aim, aim high. It
pays.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wasn’t thinking of aiming at all,” said
Wayne. “I don’t reckon I could play baseball
good enough for a real team.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you could and maybe you couldn’t,”
replied Pattern. “Anyway, don’t throw up a good
job on the off-chance of becoming a Ty Cobb or
a Baker.”</p>

<p>Big Tom took himself off, disgruntled and
grumbling, and Pattern swung himself to the platform
at Wayne’s side. “How old are you?” he
asked, and raised his eyebrows when Wayne told
him seventeen. “I’d have thought you were
eighteen, anyway,” he said. “Played much?”</p>

<p>“I played four years at home,” answered
Wayne, “on my school team. And one summer
with a team we got up in our town.”</p>

<p>“That all? Well, some fellows are like that.
Sort of born with the baseball knack. Comes
naturally to them. My roommate in college was
that sort. He didn’t have to learn, you might
say. He was the shiftiest shortstop I ever saw
outside professional teams. You sort of remind
me of him the way you handle the ball.”</p>

<p>“Do they really pay as much as twenty dollars
a week?” asked Wayne. “I mean just for fielders.
Of course I know that pitchers and star batters
get lots of money, but I always thought most of
it was just—just on paper.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“There are all sorts of salaries. You get somewhere
near what you’re worth, as a general thing.
Twenty a week is poor pay for a good fielder, my
boy, even in the bushes. Thirty-five’s more like
it.”</p>

<p>“Thirty-five dollars a week!” exclaimed Wayne.
“Why, that’s more than two hundred a month!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe it figures out something like that,”
laughed the other. “But, mind you, I’m not saying
you could get that. Probably you couldn’t
get anything yet. You’re a year or two too
young. If I were you, and thought seriously of
playing professional ball, I’d get on some amateur
team this year and play with them for the
practice.”</p>

<p>“What’s the difference, please, between an
amateur team and a professional?”</p>

<p>“Money. On an amateur team you play for the
love of playing and nothing else. On a professional
team you play for the love of playing plus
a fat salary.”</p>

<p>“I see,” murmured Wayne. “But could I—I
mean would you——”</p>

<p>“Sure, if I needed the money,” was the answer.
“I wouldn’t be a professional ball player and
expect to stick at it all my life. You can’t do it.
The pace is too hard. But if I had the ability and
could command a good salary for playing ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
I’d do it, and keep my eyes open for something
better. I know a chap who played professional
ball for six years and studied law in the winter
and whenever he got a chance. Then he went into
an office two winters. After that he quit baseball
and now he’s doing well over in Trenton. Lots
of folks think professional baseball is like highway
robbery or something. They class professional
ball players and prize fighters and thugs all
together. I guess there was a time when some
ball players were a roughish lot, but that’s gone
by. Most of them are just like the rest of us
nowadays. A lot of them lead cleaner lives than
the folks who knock them. They have to, for one
thing. Anyway, they do it. You can be a professional
ball player now and be a gentleman, too.
Most of them are. A great many are college
fellows; practically all are educated. They don’t
expect to make a life’s work of it, you see.
They’ve got the gift of playing good ball and they
turn it into money, just the same as a man who
has the gift of teaching Greek turns it into money.
It’s just a business proposition. Where your
ball player has it on some of the rest of us is just
here: he likes his work and we don’t!”</p>

<p>Pattern knocked the ashes from his pipe against
the edge of the platform and yawned. “I’ve got
to get back,” he announced. “It’s nearly one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Think over what I said about joining an amateur
team and getting practice, my boy. That’s your
best move.” He nodded, smiled, and hurried
away, leaving Wayne, for some reason, rather
excited.</p>

<p>He had never considered playing baseball for
a living, had never taken his ability seriously.
He had known since he was fourteen that he could
field and throw and bat far better than his playmates,
but he had accepted the fact without concern.
They had made him captain of his school
team in his last year and he had led them through
a season of almost uninterrupted victories. And
that summer he had played twice a week with
the “White Sox,” a local aggregation formed by
the young men and older boys in Sleepersville,
holding down third base with phenomenal success
and winning renown with his bat. But never until
today had it occurred to him that he might perhaps
earn money in such a simple way as playing
a game he loved. It didn’t sound sensible, he
thought. Why, he would be glad to play baseball
for his board and lodging alone! Glad to do it
for nothing if he could afford to! To receive
thirty-five dollars a week, or even twenty, for
doing it sounded absurd. But, of course, fellows
did get paid for it, and—and—well, it was something
to think over!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>He thought it over a good deal during the succeeding
days. He had another talk with Pattern,
waylaying him one evening on his return from the
coal office. He had, he said, decided to follow the
other’s advice about joining an amateur team,
but he didn’t know how to do it, didn’t know
where there was such a team.</p>

<p>“There’s one here in Medfield,” replied Pattern.
“Two, in fact. The Athletics have a pretty
fair bunch, but I don’t believe they’d take you
on. They’re rather a silk-stocking lot. The other
team is the Chenango. Younger fellows mostly:
the Y. M. C. A. bunch. By the way, you don’t
belong to the Y. M. C. A., do you? Why don’t
you join? It won’t cost you much of anything
and will do you a lot of good all around. You’ll
meet fellows, for one thing. I’ll get you an application,
Sloan. It’s something you ought to do,
my boy.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to very much,” said Wayne. “But
I’m afraid I wouldn’t have much time for playing
ball. You see, I have to work until five every
day.”</p>

<p>“Most of the others do, too, I guess. They
usually hold practice after that time. You’ll have
your Saturday afternoons to yourself after the
middle of June, and they only play on Saturdays.
You join the Association, Sloan, and I’ll make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
you acquainted with some of the chaps there.
You’ll find them a nice lot. And I guess you
won’t have much trouble getting a chance to
play.”</p>

<p>Pattern—his full name was Arthur Pattern,
as Wayne eventually learned—was as good as his
word and four days later Wayne was a member
of the Medfield Young Men’s Christian Association
and had increased his list of acquaintances
about two hundred per cent. The Association had
a comfortable building in the new business district,
with a well-equipped gymnasium, a small
auditorium, reading, lounging, and game rooms,
and a few bedrooms at the top of the building,
one of which Arthur Pattern occupied. Pattern,
Wayne learned, was not a native of Medfield, but
had come there a year before from a small town
in New Hampshire, where his folks still resided.
Pattern preferred his room at the Y. M. C. A.
to similar accommodation at a boarding-house.
It was in Pattern’s little room that Wayne made
a clean breast of his adventures for the past three
months. His host, who had vouched for him to
the Association without knowing any more about
him than had been revealed to him in their few
meetings in the freight yard, had asked no questions,
but Wayne thought he owed some account
of himself to his new friend. Pattern listened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
interestedly, and when Wayne had ended shook
his head slowly.</p>

<p>“It’s none of my business, Sloan,” he said,
“and I don’t know what you were up against
back home, but this thing of running away is
usually a pretty poor business. However, that’s
done now. One thing I would do if I were you,
though, is write back and tell your stepfather
where you are and how you are. I guess you owe
him that much. Will you do that?”</p>

<p>Wayne consented doubtfully. “I wouldn’t
want him to come after me, though, and fetch me
home with him,” he said.</p>

<p>“I dare say he could do that, but I don’t believe
he would. From what you’ve told me of
him—or, maybe, from what you haven’t told me—I
gather that he might be rather relieved to be rid
of the expense of clothing and feeding you, Sloan.
Anything in that?”</p>

<p>“A heap, I reckon. I don’t mind his knowing
where I am as long as he doesn’t make trouble.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what trouble he could make,” objected
Pattern. “Anyway, you’d feel better for
writing. I’d tell him why I left, that I was well
and getting on and that I meant to make my own
way.”</p>

<p>“June wrote to his mother a little while after
we got here, so I reckon Mr. Higgins knows I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
still alive. June didn’t tell where we were,
though.”</p>

<p>“Where did he mail his letter?” asked the
other. “Here in Medfield?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then it seems to me he may have a suspicion,”
laughed Pattern.</p>

<p>“I never thought of that!” exclaimed Wayne,
joining the laughter. “I reckon if he’d wanted
me back he’d been after me before this, then.
I’ll write tonight, before I go home.”</p>

<p>“I would. What about this boy that’s with
you? Why doesn’t he join here, too?”</p>

<p>“June? Why, he—he’s coloured!”</p>

<p>“So you said. What’s that got to do with it?
Isn’t he a clean, decent boy?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, but—I thought——”</p>

<p>“We don’t draw the colour line up here, Sloan.
We’ve got more than a dozen coloured fellows
in the Association right now. Some of them are
mighty well liked, too. You’d better get your
friend to come in. It’ll be good for him and
good for us. We’re trying to get all the new
members we can. See if you can’t persuade
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he will join if I tell him to,” responded
Wayne carelessly. “But it seems—sort of
funny——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, but you’re not down in Dixie now, my
boy. Remember that.”</p>

<p>For once, however, Wayne’s authority failed
him. June firmly and respectfully declined to have
anything to do with the Y. M. C. A. “Maybe it’s
jus’ like you-all say, Mas’ Wayne, but I ain’ fixin’
to act like these yere Northern darkies, no, sir!
I done watch ’em. They acts like they thought
they was quality, Mas’ Wayne, dressin’ themselves
up in store clothes an’ buttin’ white folks
right off’n the sidewalk! If they was down in
Colquitt County someone’d hit ’em over the head
with a axe!”</p>

<p>“But this isn’t Colquitt County, June. This is
up North, and things are different here. Up here
a coloured man is as good as a white man—at
least they think he is.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, Mas’ Wayne, they don’ think that,
sir. They jus’ perten’ they thinks it. Don’ no
white man sit down to a table with a nigger, does
they? They lets you ride in the same car with the
white folks, but you can’ go to white folkses hotel.
It’s mighty mixed up, Mas’ Wayne, an’ you don’
know where you is!”</p>

<p>“But there are a lot of coloured fellows in
the Y. M. C. A., June. Doesn’t that show that it’s
all right for you to join it?”</p>

<p>“Shows it’s all right for them, Mas’ Wayne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
but it don’ prove nothin’ to me! I jus’ wouldn’
care for it. White folks is white folks an’ niggers
is niggers, an’ there ain’ no gettin’ aroun’
it, Mas’ Wayne. No, sir, don’ you ask me to join
no ’Sociation, Mas’ Wayne.”</p>

<p>Secretly, Wayne was a little relieved at June’s
decision, for he held the same views on the subject.
He and June had been playmates when they
were tiny, companions later, and friends always,
but he had been brought up in the firm conviction
that the negro was an inferior race. Whether
he was right or wrong I don’t pretend to know.</p>

<p>At all events, June remained firm. By this time
he was flourishing exceedingly. His deposit had
been paid and he was now getting three dollars
every Monday from the proprietor of the hotel
and earning an average of twice that amount in
tips, all of which, it may be truthfully stated, he
did his honest best to deserve. He was easily the
most popular of the four bell boys employed at
the hotel, and, since envy and malice are not confined
to those with white skins, he had had his
troubles. The head bell boy who, prior to June’s
advent, had ruled the roost with a high hand,
levying toll on the earnings of the other and
younger boys, had not yielded his rule without
a struggle. But he had run up against a Tartar
in June, for the latter refused to either acknowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the other’s right of dominion or give up
any of his earnings to him. The eventual result
was a decisive battle with fists in the furnace-room,
a bout in which June, in spite of smaller
size and weight, conclusively proved his superiority.
The head bell boy retired from public life
for the space of one whole day, and, when he returned,
brought back with him a meek and respectful
demeanour. June didn’t deceive himself into
thinking that the other was any fonder of him for
the beating he had received, but he was quite sure
that thereafter he would be let alone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Wayne learned a little better every
day how to make himself useful to Jim Mason
and every day grew to find more interest in his
work. He became a great favourite with the men
around the freight yard, while Jim never missed
an opportunity to do him any kindness in his
power. Frequently Wayne was invited to the
house with the sun-parlor for supper or Sunday
dinner, and less frequently he accepted the invitation
and went. He was always certain of good,
well-cooked food which, if plain, was abundant.
Mrs. Mason had long since learned of Wayne’s
rescue of Terry and could never do enough for
him. Terry, too, welcomed the visitor, evincing
an almost embarrassing enthusiasm for his
society. Wayne was duly introduced to the wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
hen—whose name, strangely enough,
proved to be Teddie—and to her even more
wonderful brood of chickens, four in number.</p>

<p>In consequence of new friends and new interests,
Wayne naturally spent less time at “Carhurst”
and saw less of June. But June, too, had
found friends amongst his own race and was not
lonesome. In fact, he confided to Wayne one evening
after supper, while the latter was anxiously
examining the growth of his plants and watering
them from the dish pan, that he “liked this yere
place right smart,” adding that he “reckoned it
wasn’t never intended they should go to New
York.” June had blossomed forth in new clothes
which, while extremely inexpensive, made him
look quite fine. Wayne tried to tease him by
saying that he was just like a Northern nigger
now, but June didn’t mind. “’Tain’ your clothes,
Mas’ Wayne, that makes you ’spectable,” he said.
“It’s the way you acts!”</p>

<p>Wayne, too, had provided himself with new
attire. It was Arthur Pattern who tactfully
hinted at the advisability of enlarging his wardrobe,
something that Wayne had had in mind for
a fortnight and had been deterred from doing only
by the realisation of the tremendous hole the outlay
would make in his savings. When he did
emerge from the clothing store carrying a neat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
blue serge suit in a big pasteboard box he was as
near penniless as one could be and have a jingle
left in his pocket! But the expenditure paid for
itself if only in the comfortable feeling of being
decently dressed when Wayne went to the Y. M.
C. A. of an afternoon, as had become his custom.
Usually Arthur Pattern stopped for him on his
way past the freight house and they walked uptown
together. Wayne saw his circle of acquaintances
grow from day to day, thanks to Arthur,
and it wasn’t long before he could truthfully echo
June’s sentiments and say that he “liked this
yere place right smart.” And finally, as May was
drawing to its end, he secured what he had hoped
for from the first, an invitation to join the
Chenango Base-Ball Club squad and show what
he could do.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>THE CHENANGO CLUB</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The club had already played several games by
that time, but, as all the members were either
attending high school or employed at work, one
day’s line-up was seldom like another’s. Captain
Taylor never knew until the last moment which
of his team members would be able to play and in
consequence he tried to have two good players
for every position. Practice was held in a field
on the edge of town leased by the Association.
It wasn’t either very level or very spacious, but
it sufficed. It had a board fence around it, contained
a small grand stand, a shed which answered
the purpose of dressing-room, a cinder track, one-eighth
mile in circumference, and jumping pits.
The practice hour was five o’clock, or as soon
after as the fellows could reach the field, and they
kept at it as long as daylight lasted or hunger
would go unappeased.</p>

<p>Wayne found some twenty-odd fellows in attendance
the afternoon of his first appearance.
All of them wore a uniform of some description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
or a portion of one. All, that is, save Wayne, who
had given no thought to the matter of attire. Still,
he was no worse off than Hoffman, whose regalia
consisted of a pair of football trousers and stockings
in combination with his usual street clothes.
Hoffman was a catcher, and when he donned mask
and protector he made a laughable appearance.
His first name was Augustus, but he had been
known as Gus until he had become a clerk in the
office of the gas company. Now he was called
“Gas” Hoffman. He was a fairly good catcher
and a slugging batsman, as catchers so often
are.</p>

<p>Practice with the Chenangos was work very
largely diluted with play. As a captain, Joe
Taylor was anything but a martinet. Wayne,
recalling his own strict discipline when he had
captained his school team the year before, decided
that Taylor erred on the side of laxity.
Perhaps, however, the Chenango captain knew his
business, for there was a very evident disinclination
on the part of most of the candidates to take
their occupation seriously. They were there for
fun and meant to have it. Wayne had wondered
that Arthur Pattern had not tried for the team
until Arthur had explained that his playing on a
semi-professional team in New Hampshire one
summer had taken him out of the amateur class<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and that since the Chenango was a purely amateur
club he would have no right there.</p>

<p>The fellows at the field that afternoon averaged
nineteen years of age. One or two were older,
among them “Gas” Hoffman and Captain Taylor.
Gas was twenty-three and Taylor twenty-one. To
even the average, young Despaigne, who played
shortstop very cleverly, was only seventeen, and
Collins, a fielder, was scarcely older. Wayne suffered
for lack of baseball shoes that day and made
up his mind to buy a pair at the first opportunity.
There was about twenty minutes of fielding and
batting practice and then two teams were chosen
and six innings were played. Wayne was put at
third base on the second-string nine and made a
good impression in spite of his lack of practice.
At bat he failed ignominiously to hit safely even
once, but, having waited out the pitcher in one
inning, he got to first and gave a very pretty exhibition
of base-stealing a moment later, reaching
the coveted bag simultaneously with the ball but
eluding it by a dexterous hook-slide that kept him
far out of reach of the baseman’s sweep.</p>

<p>It was all over at half-past six and the fellows
walked back toward the centre of town together,
still very full of spirits, disappearing one by one
down side streets until at last only Hal Collins,
a tall youth named Wheelock, and Wayne remained.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Wheelock played first base and was thin
and angular and wore glasses over a pair of pale,
peering eyes. He was about nineteen, Wayne
judged, and had a slow, drawling manner of
speech and a dry humour. Collins was a quick,
nervous youngster, inclined to be sarcastic.
Wayne liked Jim Wheelock best, although for a
while he was never sure whether Jim’s remarks
were serious or otherwise. It was Jim who
praised Wayne’s throws to first base as they
tramped along Whitney Street.</p>

<p>“You peg the ball across like you were looking
where you were sending it,” drawled Jim. “Playing
first would be a cinch if they all did that,
Sloan.”</p>

<p>“Jim’s idea of playing first,” said Hal Collins,
“is to stand on the bag and pick ’em off his
chest. He hates to reach for anything.”</p>

<p>“My arms are four inches longer than they
were before I started playing ball with this gang,”
responded Jim, “and I’ve got joints in my legs
that aren’t human!”</p>

<p>“Don’t any of them look human to me,” said
Hal. “Say, where was Harry Brewster today?
Someone said he was sick or something.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s got the sleeping disease,” answered
Jim gravely. “Had it ever since he got his berth
in the State National. That’s why they call it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
berth when you get a job in a bank. They give
you a column of figures to add up in the morning
and if you’re not asleep by half-past ten they
fire you. About four they go around with a pole
and jab it through the cages. If you don’t wake
up then they put a blanket over you and lock
you in. They say Harry’s the best little sleeper
they’ve got. Wouldn’t wonder if they made him
president pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, quit your kidding,” laughed Hal. “What
<em>is</em> the matter with him, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Cold. Went to sleep on a New York draft
yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Sure it wasn’t counting coins? You can catch
gold that way, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it’s not so hard to check. Good-night,
fellows.” Jim tramped off down a side street
and Collins asked Wayne which way he went.</p>

<p>“I go down the next street,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Boarding?”</p>

<p>“No, I—we keep house. About two miles out.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Well, see you again. Here’s my turn.
Good-night.”</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when Wayne reached “Carhurst”
and June had supper ready and waiting.
Sam was ready and waiting, too, but he forgot his
hunger long enough to make a fuss over his
master. Wayne narrated his experiences of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
day while they plied busy knives and forks and
then June brought the chronicle of his life down
to date. But the most interesting item of information
to Wayne was June’s announcement that one
of the tomato plants had buds on it, and nothing
would do but that Wayne had to jump up from
“table” and rush forth in the twilight and see for
himself. The garden was showing promise by
that time, although nothing was more than a few
inches high.</p>

<p>Wayne was up early the next morning so as to
do a half-hour’s gardening before he left for
town. He had long since made the discovery that
eradicating grass from a meadow is not a simple
matter of removing the turf, for the grass was
always threatening to choke his seedlings utterly,
and it was only by watching and working that he
was able to keep it down. When he wasn’t weeding
he was poking up the dirt with a pointed
stick in lieu of trowel. June called this “coaxin’
’em,” and opined that “if they flowers don’ act
pretty, Mas’ Wayne, ’twon’ be no fault o’ yourn!”
But it was the tomato plants that interested June
most, and he was forever estimating the crop to
be picked later on from the six rather spindling
plants that they had bought at the grocer’s. He
declared that each one ought to yield fifteen “big,
red, ripe, juicy tomatuses,” and that if they consumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
only six a day the supply would provide
for them only two weeks. It was June’s firm and
oft reiterated conviction that they should have
planted just three times as many! Tomatoes
were a weakness with June.</p>

<p>But two days later he found something besides
the prospective tomato crop to interest his idle
hours. At Wayne’s invitation he met the latter
at the freight house one afternoon and accompanied
him out to the Y. M. C. A. field to watch
the doings. But just looking on never suited
June very well and it wasn’t a quarter of an hour
before he was on speaking terms with everyone
there. The fellows enjoyed hearing his soft dialect
and did their best to draw him out, punctuating
his remarks with laughter. June was speedily
established on the bench, and from just sitting
idly there to presiding over the bats and the
fortunes of the players was but a short step.</p>

<p>“Jus’ you let me choose you a bat, Mister
Cap’n. I goin’ put a conjur on this yere stick o’
wood, sir, an’ you-all’s goin’ to everlastin’ly lam
that yere ball, yes, sir!”</p>

<p>As it happened Joe Taylor did “everlastingly
lam the ball,” sending it over left fielder’s head,
and June’s reputation as a prophet, as well as
his status as Keeper of the Bats, was firmly established.
He was back again the next day, good-natured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and smiling and anxious to serve, and
was welcomed like a long-lost friend. June was
never “fresh,” no matter how many opportunities
were presented, nor would he accept the footing
of equality that was offered him. He picked
up the bat hurled aside by the man streaking to
first and dropped it neatly in its place in front of
the bench, soon knew which bat each player liked
best and was ready with it, saw that the water
pail was kept filled and, in brief, filled the office of
general factotum so well that the question arose
of how they had ever got along without him!</p>

<p>It was Jim Wheelock who suggested June’s
adoption as official club mascot. “No wonder we
don’t win more’n half our games,” drawled Jim.
“We’ve never had a mascot. Here’s our chance,
fellows. That darkey was just created to be a
mascot. You can see it written all over him.
Here’s where our luck changes.”</p>

<p>“We’ll stake him to a uniform,” suggested Joe
Taylor, “and take him over to Ludlow Saturday.
Guess we’ll have style if nothing else!”</p>

<p>June was complacent, even proud. “Fetch
along your uniform, Mister Cap’n,” he said.
“Only don’ you put no stripes on it, please, sir.”
When, however, June learned that he was required
to take train with the fellows at two o’clock he
was dubious. “Don’ know about that, gen’lemen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
You see, I got a mighty ’portant position at the
hotel an’ I dunno will my boss let me off.”</p>

<p>“We’ll ask him to, June,” replied Taylor.
“He’s a regular baseball fan himself and never
misses a home game, I guess. He won’t kick. You
leave it to us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, jus’ as you says. I surely would love
to ’company you-all. I reckon Mas’ Wayne won’
have no objection.”</p>

<p>“Who? Sloan? What’s he got to say about
it, June?” demanded Hal Collins. “He doesn’t
own you, does he?”</p>

<p>“Don’ nobody <em>own</em> me,” replied June, “but
Mas’ Wayne he got the say-so, yes, sir.”</p>

<p>So Wayne was called into consultation and gave
his permission, and on Saturday, when the team,
fourteen strong as to players and half a hundred
strong as to “rooters,” left Medfield they took
with them one Junius Brutus Bartow Tasker
radiantly attired in a bran-new suit of light gray
flannel, with a pair of blue stockings and a jaunty
cap. The shirt was a great joy to June, for on
the left side was a big blue “C” surrounding an
Indian’s head. Jim Wheelock told him the
Indian was Mr. Chenango, after whom the club
was named, and that he had been in his time a
celebrated first baseman with the Susquehannock
Club of the Passamaquoddy League. How much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of that June believed I can’t say, but he certainly
was proud of those baseball togs.</p>

<p>They played the Ludlow Y. M. C. A. that afternoon
and were beaten ingloriously, 14 to 4. The
Chenangos relied on their second-best pitcher,
and his work was nearer third-best on that occasion.
Wayne got a chance in the eighth inning,
pinch-hitting for Despaigne, who was never a
strong batter, and subsequently going in at third
when a substitute was wanted. Wayne did well
enough in the infield but failed to hit, which was
about the way with the others. Hitting was the
Chenangos’ weak point that day. Pitching was
another, however, scarcely less lamentable. As
Jim Wheelock said on the way home, it would
have taken eighteen fellows instead of nine to keep
Ludlow from scoring her runs. Jordan, the substitute
pitcher, was hit “fast, far, and frequent,”
and the tiredest members of the visiting team
were the outfielders.</p>

<p>Several good-natured jibes were aimed at June
on the return trip, but June didn’t mind them a
bit. “Ain’ no mascot as ever was, gen’lemen, can
change the luck for a team that ain’ hittin’. I
done my mascotin’ all right, but you gen’lemen
didn’ give me no kind o’ support!”</p>

<p>There was one thing about his companions that
Wayne admired, and that was their good nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
in defeat. He remembered that when his school
team had returned from that disastrous contest
with Athens High gloom thick enough to be cut
with a knife had enveloped them. After all, playing
ball was sport and not business, and why
should they be downhearted over a defeat?
Whether they should or not, they certainly were
not. Even Jordan, who had so ignominiously
failed in the box, seemed no whit upset, nor did
the rest hold it against him. They had quite as
merry a time of it returning home as they had had
going to Ludlow.</p>

<p>But it was apparent on Monday that Captain
Taylor meant to do better the next time. Several
substitutes were changed over into the first nine,
and Wayne was amongst them. Wayne was
bothered because he couldn’t hit the ball as he was
capable of hitting it, but comforted himself with
the assurance that practice would bring back his
former skill. But it didn’t seem to. In the next
four practice games he secured but one clean hit,
a two-bagger, and a very doubtful “scratch.” He
confided to June one evening that he was afraid
he had forgotten how to hit. “That fellow Chase
isn’t nearly as much of a pitcher as Ned Calhoun
was, and I never had much trouble with Ned,
did I?”</p>

<p>“Mas’ Wayne,” said June, “I done been watchin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
you, sir, an’ I goin’ to tell you-all jus’ what
the trouble is.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” sighed Wayne. “What
is it?”</p>

<p>“You-all’s too anxious. Anxiousness jus’
sticks out all over you when you goes to bat. Now
the nex’ time, Mas’ Wayne, jus’ you go up there
an’ tell you’self you don’ care ’tall if you hits or
if you don’ hit. Jus’ you forget how anxious you
is an’ watch that ol’ pill an’ hit it on the nose.
If you does that, sir, you’s goin’ to see it travel,
yes, sir!”</p>

<p>Wayne thought it over and decided that perhaps
June had really found the trouble. At all
events, the advice sounded good and he determined
to try to profit by it. The result wasn’t
very encouraging the next day, but on Friday he
had the satisfaction of getting two hard singles,
and after that his return to form was speedy.
Neither Chase, the Chenangos’ best twirler, nor
Jordan, who was capable of pitching very decent
ball when at his best, had any further terror for
him. He lambasted them both impartially, much
to June’s delight. “What did I done tell you,
Mas’ Wayne?” he demanded as Wayne returned
to the bench after turning his second hit into a
run with the aid of Gas Hoffman’s single and a
stolen base. “Ain’ nobody else got them two hits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
today yet, sir. Reckon you’s done come into your
own again, Mas’ Wayne!”</p>

<p>They went up against the Athletics, the team
that Arthur Pattern had referred to as “a silk-stocking
lot,” the next afternoon and scored a
victory when, with the bases full in the seventh,
Larry Colton banged a two-bagger down the alley
into right. The three resulting runs put the Chenangos
two tallies to the good and there they
stayed in spite of the Athletics’ desperate efforts
to score in the eighth and ninth. It was Wayne
who cut off a run in the first of those two innings
when he reached far above his head and brought
down what was labelled “two bases” when it left
the bat. A perfect peg to second caught the
runner flat-footed and retired the side.</p>

<p>That play, together with two singles and a base
on balls in four times at bat, settled Wayne’s
right to a position on the team. In fact, he was
already spoken of as the best player in the infield,
although to Wayne it seemed that no amateur
could handle himself and the ball as Victor Despaigne
did at shortstop. But Despaigne, while
he fielded almost miraculously, was a more uncertain
thrower, and only Jim Wheelock’s reach—and,
possibly, those extra joints of which he
had told—saved him from many errors.</p>

<p>The regular second baseman was a chap named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Tad Stearns. Tad played his position steadily
if not spectacularly, and Captain Taylor was perfectly
satisfied with him. It was Tad who almost
invariably took Hoffman’s throws to the second
bag and who was always a stumbling-block in the
way of second-nine fellows seeking to win renown
as base-stealers. When, some three weeks after
Wayne’s connection with the team, Tad fell down
an elevator shaft in the carpet factory where he
was employed as shipping clerk and broke his left
arm and otherwise incapacitated himself for either
work or play for some two months to follow, Taylor
was left in a quandary. Tad Stearns’ understudy,
Herrick, was not good enough, and when
the news reached the field one afternoon that Tad
was out of the game for the rest of the summer
there was a consultation that included everyone
on hand. As frequently occurred, it was Jim
Wheelock who offered the most promising solution.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you let Sloan go to second,” he
asked, “and put Whiteback at third? You want
a good man on second.”</p>

<p>“That might do,” answered Joe, “if Sloan can
play second. Ever try it, Sloan?”</p>

<p>“I’ve played second a little,” Wayne answered.
“I’ll be glad to try it again if you like.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Hoffman, swinging his mask,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
“that’s the best way out of it. Beat it down there,
Sloan, and I’ll slip you a few throws. You and
Vic ought to work together finely.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Captain Taylor, “we’ll try it
that way. Billy White, you take third, will you?
It’s just like Tad to fall down a shaft right in the
middle of the season,” he ended grumblingly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jim drily, “he never did have any
consideration for folks. Thoughtless, I call him.”</p>

<p>Joe grinned. “Oh, well, I suppose he didn’t
mean to do it,” he answered. “I must drop
around this evening and see how he is. All right,
fellows! Let’s get at it!”</p>

<p>So that is how Wayne became a second instead
of a third baseman. After two or three days in
the position he decided, and all who watched him
in action decided, that second was where he belonged.
He took throws from the plate nicely
and developed an almost uncanny ability to outguess
the base-runner, and the way he blocked
him off was good to see. He had to guard against
over-throwing to first for a while, for the distance
was strange, but it didn’t take him long to learn
to snap instead of speeding them to Wheelock.
The best thing of all, however, was the way in
which he and Vic Despaigne fitted into each
other. As Gas Hoffman had predicted, they
worked together nicely and double plays began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to be so frequent as to scarcely merit remark. At
third, White got along very well, although he was
scarcely as dependable as Wayne had been. He
got better as the season progressed, however, and
by the first of July the Chenango infield was about
as good as they make them for amateur teams.</p>

<p>Up to that time the club had played seven
games, of which it had won three, lost three, and
tied one. The Fourth of July contest was with
the Toonalta A. A., and, since Toonalta had beaten
Joe’s charges the year before and the year before
that, Chenango was very anxious to score a victory.
The game was to be played at Medfield, a
fact calculated to favour the home team, and Joe
and most of the others were quite hopeful. But
Joe didn’t allow that to keep him from putting the
nine through some very strenuous practice during
the week preceding the contest.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>MEDFIELD CELEBRATES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Medfield began her celebration of the Fourth
about twenty-four hours ahead of time and gradually
worked up to a top-notch of noise, eloquence,
and patriotism at approximately one o’clock
Tuesday afternoon, at which hour the observances
in City Park were at their height. Everyone had
turned out, in spite of the almost unbearable heat,
and every club or association, from the Grand
Army Post to the Medfield Women’s Civic Association,
had marched in the procession that,
headed by a platoon of police and a very stout
Grand Marshal seated precariously on one of
Callahan’s livery horses, had, in the words of the
next day’s <cite>Morning Chronicle</cite>, “taken just forty-eight
minutes to pass a given point.” The
<cite>Chronicle</cite> neglected, however, to mention the fact
that the given point to which it referred was the
Grand Street crossing where the procession had
been held up quite ten minutes by an inconsiderate
freight train! Still, it was a fine parade, any way
you looked at it. The Fire Department made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
glorious showing, the Sons of Veterans marched
well in spite of the small boys who got under their
feet, the High School Cadets displayed quite a
martial appearance, and the various floats, from
that of the Women’s Civic Association, which depicted
a somewhat wabbly, Grecian-robed America
accepting a liberty cap from General Washington,
down to the clattering, tinkling wagon hung with
tin pans and dippers and plates and dustpans that
represented the Medfield Stamping Works, all
added to the brilliance of the occasion!</p>

<p>You may be certain that neither Wayne nor
June missed that parade. On the contrary, they
viewed it four separate and distinct times, dodging
through side streets as soon as the tail end
had passed and reaching a new point of vantage
before the head of it appeared. June was frankly
disappointed in that the Grand Marshal managed
somehow to remain in the saddle until the very
end and then left it of his own free will and, it is
suspected, very thankfully. June remained hopeful
to the last, but was doomed to disappointment.
He had a wearied, sleepy appearance today, had
June, explained by the fact that he had stayed up
all last night with some of his cronies, doing his
best to make the occasion memorable in the annals
of Medfield, assisting at the lighting and nourishing
of the bonfire on Tannery Hill, observing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
firing of the cannon in the park at dawn, and finally
returning to “Carhurst” at breakfast time with
the look of one completely surfeited with pleasure.
Wayne had been rather cross at first, but his
anger had subsided at sight of June’s left hand.
June, it seemed, had lighted a Roman candle and,
unwisely obeying the instructions of an acquaintance,
had held it by the business end. He hadn’t
held it that way long, but long enough to burn
the palm of his hand so badly that he had to wear
a bandage for nearly a week.</p>

<p>The two boys listened to the speeches and singing
at the park, ate a hurried and fragmentary
dinner at a downtown lunch-room, and then hied
themselves to the Y. M. C. A. field. The game
with Toonalta was to begin at half-past two, but
owing to the fact that Joe Taylor and Jim
Wheelock and one or two others had spent the
noontime swaying about on top of the Association
float and that it took them some time to change
from Historical Personages to baseball players,
it was nearly three when, before an audience that
crowded the stand and flowed over on both sides
of the field, Pete Chase wound up and sent the
first delivery speeding across the plate for a
strike.</p>

<p>It was a sizzling hot afternoon, with scarcely
a breath of air blowing across the diamond. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
glare on the gray-brown dirt of the base path
hurt the eyes, and Wayne, clad in almost immaculate,
new baseball togs, felt the perspiration trickling
down his back and from under the edge of his
cap. Between him and the pitcher’s box heat
waves danced and shimmered. His throwing hand
was moist and he wiped it on a trouser leg. The
Chenango infield was talking hearteningly to
Chase and each other, Jim Wheelock’s drawl
mingling with Vic Despaigne’s sharp staccato.
There were two umpires that day and Wayne was
wondering how the one on the bases stood the heat
in his blue flannel attire, with his coat buttoned
tightly from chin to waist. Chase wasted one
and then put a second strike across. Medfield’s
adherents cheered and the chatter in the field increased
again. Then there was a <em>crack</em> and Chase
put up a lazy gloved hand, turned and tossed the
ball to Jim. One out!</p>

<p>After that, for several innings, Wayne forgot
how hot he was. East, the Toonalta left fielder,
also fell victim to Chase’s slants, but Burns,
second baseman, slammed a hard one at Despaigne
and that youth made his first error. Although he
recovered his fumble like lightning, the runner,
a fast chap on the dirt, was safe by the time the
ball was in Jim Wheelock’s hands. A single past
White sent the runner to second and placed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
rival shortstop on first, but the trouble ended a
few minutes later when Pete Chase scored his
third strike-out in one inning.</p>

<p>Joe Taylor had rearranged his line-up for
today’s battle. Hal Collins, left fielder, led off
and was followed by Wheelock, first baseman,
Taylor, right fielder, Colton, centre fielder, White,
third baseman, Hoffman, catcher, Sloan, second
baseman, Despaigne, shortstop, and Chase,
pitcher.</p>

<p>The Toonalta pitcher, Ellis by name, was
heralded as a wonder, and before the game started
the team was undeniably in awe of him. But by
the time the first inning was at an end the awe had
disappeared. Nor did it return, for only one
strike-out did Ellis have to his credit when the
contest was over, and that the game went as it
did was due rather to the Toonalta fielding than
to the twirler’s science. It was a hitting game
from first to last, a game in which slip-ups in fielding
by either side would have spelled disaster at
any moment. As for strike-outs, after the first
inning Chase hung up but two more scalps, giving
him, however, a creditable total of five for the
game.</p>

<p>It was Hal Collins who took the first jab at
Ellis’ reputation as a pitcher. Hal failed to hit
safely, but his fly to deep centre on the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
ball pitched might easily have gone for three bags,
and the fielder’s catch, made on the run, brought
a salvo of applause from friend and foe alike.
Jim Wheelock, with the score two-and-two, sent
a sharp single down the first base line. Joe
Taylor tried hard to land safely but only succeeded
in dropping an easy one into shortstop’s
glove and Colton brought the inning to an end by
banging a low fly to right fielder. Jim never got
beyond first, but as every man up had connected
in some fashion with Ellis’ delivery the home
team’s respect for his skill fell to zero.</p>

<p>In Toonalta’s second things began to happen
at once. The brown-stockinged first baseman hit
between Wayne and Jim Wheelock for a base and
only a fine stop and throw by Joe Taylor kept
him from taking second. The next man hit to
Wayne, and Wayne fielded to Despaigne, cutting
off the first runner by a yard. There was, though,
no chance for a double. With one on, Browne,
Toonalta’s right fielder, let Chase work two
strikes across before he found anything to his
liking. Perhaps Chase held him too lightly. At
all events the fourth offering was a perfectly
straight, fast ball and the batsman leaned against
it hard, so hard that the sphere cleared Chase’s
head at a speed roughly estimated at a mile a
minute, climbed up out of Wayne’s reach, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
kept right on going. And when it finally did
come to earth no one saw it, for it landed somewhere
beyond the fence at the far end of the field!
The handful of Toonalta “rooters” stood up and
shouted themselves hoarse and blared through
red, white, and blue megaphones and waved anything
they could lay their hands on, while a deep
and all-pervading silence rested over the Medfield
forces. Two runs came across and things looked
rather blue for the home team, or perhaps I should
say brown, since brown was the Toonalta colour.</p>

<p>The discredited Ellis fouled out to Gas Hoffman
and the head of the visitors’ list was thrown
out, Despaigne to Wheelock, and the trouble was
over for the moment. For Chenango, Billy White
led off with a safety to left and went to second a
minute later when first baseman let Ellis’ throw
go past him. Hoffman hit to Ellis, the pitcher
spearing the ball with his gloved hand and holding
White at second. Wayne produced the third
safety of the game by trickling a slow one down
the first base line, sending White to third and
putting himself on first. Despaigne hit to second
baseman and the latter hurled to the plate, getting
Billy White. Wayne took second and Despaigne
was safe at first. Chase worried Ellis for a pass
and the bases were full. Medfield howled gleefully
as Hal Collins stepped to the plate, for a hit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
would tie up the game. But there were two down
and Ellis tightened up, and, with two balls and
one strike on him, Collins bit at a bad one and
it came down into third baseman’s waiting hands
just over the foul line.</p>

<p>But that inning encouraged the Chenangos, for,
as Joe Taylor said confidently, if they kept on
hitting Ellis as they had been hitting him something
was sure to break lose sooner or later.
June, presiding at the bats and lording it a bit in
his fine uniform, predicted ruin and desolation
for the enemy in the fifth inning. “Ain’ nothin’
goin’ to happen till then,” he declared, looking
wise and rolling his eyes, “but when it do happen
it’s goin’ to happen, yes, sir! You min’ my words,
gen’lemen!” June wasn’t far wrong, either, as
things turned out, for nothing did happen until
the fifth and even if that inning didn’t prove quite
as disastrous to the enemy as he had predicted,
why, perhaps, that wasn’t his fault.</p>

<p>Four men faced Chase in the third, the first getting
a scratch hit, the second sacrificing him to
the next bag and the other two proving easy outs.
In the home team’s half, Jim Wheelock flied out
to centre fielder, Joe Taylor to first baseman—it
was a hot liner, but the chap held onto it—and
Colton went out third to first. In the fourth,
Toonalta started out with a walk, followed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
a sacrifice hit, a fly to Collins in left field, another
pass and still another one—three for the inning.
Then Jordan was warming up over behind third
and the infield was begging Chase to take his time
and stop fooling, and, with bases filled, half a
hundred seemingly insane spectators yelling like
wild Indians, Gas Hoffman looking pretty set
about the mouth and Pete Chase plainly slipping,
hit a long fly to Collins and so ended as nerve-racking
a quarter of an hour as the contest provided!
When that ball settled into Hal Collins’
hands the shout that went up must certainly have
been heard at the corner of Main and Whitney
Streets, which is equivalent to saying a mile and a
half away! Anyone who has played through that
sort of a half-inning knows the vast and blessed
relief that comes when the end arrives and the
men on bases turn, grumbling, away and the team
trots triumphantly in. They pounded each other’s
backs and slapped Chase on the shoulder and
shook hands with him quite as though he had
not himself caused all the anxiety and suspense.
June’s face was one big, white-toothed
grin!</p>

<p>“That’s their last chance!” proclaimed Captain
Taylor. “They’ll never get another one like
it. Now, then, fellows, let’s go in and cop this
game right now!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>But they didn’t. Billy White hit a weak one
to Ellis and was out by a mile. Hoffman popped
up a mean little foul to the catcher and Wayne,
hitting safely to short left, obeyed instructions
and tried to stretch the hit to two bases and
was caught a foot off by a fine throw from left
fielder.</p>

<p>Again Toonalta secured a hit, her fifth, after
one man was gone in the first half of the next
inning. It was Gore, shortstop, who performed
the feat, and it was Gore who gave as pretty an
exhibition of base-stealing as one ever sees. He
stole second when the Toonalta catcher struck out
and blocked Hoffman’s throw and then stole third
a moment later. Gas got the ball to White as
quick as he could, but Gore was already sliding
his cleats against the bag. Even Medfield cheered
that exploit, realising the next instant that, even
with two down, everything predicted another tally
for the enemy. But once more Fortune favoured
the Blues. Or perhaps the credit should go to
Pete Chase. At least, Wayne didn’t deserve much
of it, for the ball that came at him was breast-high
and he didn’t have to move from his tracks to
take it. Anyhow, it ended another anxious
moment, and the Chenangos again went to
bat.</p>

<p>This was the last of the fifth, Toonalta was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
two runs to the home team’s none and it was
surely time to do something in the way of scoring
if anything was to be done. When the other
crowd is two runs to the good, and the game is
just half over, you begin to count innings!
Despaigne started out poorly enough, trickling
a bunt to third and being thrown out easily. Chase
did no better, being retired by second baseman
to first. The home team’s hopes dwindled again
and its supporters, human-like, began to grumble
and make pessimistic remarks. But Hal Collins
was hopefully applauded, nevertheless, when he
stepped to the plate, looking, as it seemed, a little
more determined than usual in spite of the smile
that curled his lips. The smile was the result of
June’s earnest plea to “Please, sir, Mister Collins,
r’ar up an’ bust it!”</p>

<p>Pitcher Ellis, with two gone, took Collins untroubledly.
He tried to sneak the first one across
for a strike, to be sure, failing narrowly, but after
that he sent in two wide ones, and Hal would have
had three balls to his credit had he not, for some
reason, swung at the third delivery, missed it
widely and made the score one-and-two. Ellis
tried a drop then; Collins had fallen for it before;
but it went unheeded and put him in the hole.
There was nothing to do then but let Collins hit—or
pass him—and Ellis wasn’t issuing many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
passes today. The next delivery was high and
over the plate, and Collins fouled it into the stand.
The next was lower and might have gone for a
ball had not the batsman swung at it, met it fairly
on the end of his bat, and sent it travelling down
the field just over first baseman’s head and hardly
more than a yard inside the foul line. It
was good for two bases and Medfield cheered
wildly.</p>

<p>“Bring him in, Jim!” cried the Blue team as
the Chenango first baseman accepted the bats that
June proffered and strode to the plate, and
“Here we go!” shouted a strong-voiced spectator.
“Here we go! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi!” A hundred
others took up his chant and beat time to it with
feet on planking or with clapping hands. Whether
the pandemonium had its effect on Pitcher Ellis
or not, certain it is that his first delivery was
grooved if ever ball was grooved, and equally
certain is it that Jim Wheelock drove it straight
past the pitcher and out of the infield and that
Hal Collins tore around from second, touched
third with flying feet and slid into the plate well
ahead of the ball!</p>

<p>“There’s one of ’em!” shrieked Hoffman.
“Let’s have another, Cap! Hit it out! Bust it!”</p>

<p>Joe Taylor tried his best to bring Jim in from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
second, but failed, finally flying out to centre field
and ending the rally.</p>

<p>Still one to two was better than two to nothing,
and the home team trotted hopefully out to their
places for the beginning of the sixth.</p>

<small>WAYNE BEATS OUT THE BALL</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Rider, the Browns’ third sack artist, waited out
two offerings and then slammed the next down the
base line to Billy White. Billy was having a bad
day, and, although he knocked the ball down, he
couldn’t heave it to Jim in time to get his man,
and another black mark was set against Billy’s
fair fame. This poor beginning was speedily
remedied, though, when the Toonalta right fielder
hit to Despaigne, and Vic, performing one of
his circus stunts, grabbed the ball as it bounded
past him well to the right and tossed it to Wayne
as the latter sped to the bag. Still going, Wayne
half turned and chucked underhand to Jim, completing
as pretty a double play as one would wish
to see. Medfield voiced delight and approval and
relief very loudly and very long while Ellis walked
to the plate and faced Chase, grimly determined
to get a hit. But Chase knew his opponent’s
weakness and toyed with him until the score
stood two strikes and one ball. Then, however,
Ellis managed to connect with the next delivery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
and send it high into the air behind first base.
For a long moment it looked safe, but Wayne got
under it after a hard run and squeezed it.</p>

<p>For the Chenangos, Colton flied out to shortstop,
Billy White hit to second and was out on a
close decision that brought a howl of protest from
the blue nine’s supporters and Hoffman made his
first—and last—hit, a bounder over shortstop’s
head. Wayne went up with the encouraging applause
of the Medfield supporters in his ears and
faced Ellis calmly. He had been twice up and
had two hits to his credit, and he meant to keep
his score perfect. But he was reckoning without
Fate, for after Ellis had pitched a wide one on
the supposition that Hoffman would steal on the
first ball, and then had sneaked a low strike across—low
ones constituted Wayne’s batting weakness,
and he knew the fact and meant to profit by the
knowledge—the hit-and-run signal came, Wayne
swung at a high one on the inside, missed it and
watched the ball hurtle down to shortstop and
saw Gas put out at second. Wayne disappointedly
tossed his bat to June and went back to the
field.</p>

<p>Toonalta started the seventh with the head of
her batting-list up. This was Brook, her centre
fielder, a player with some reputation for getting
to first and for moving along afterward. So far,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
though, he had not lived up to that reputation,
since in three times at the plate he had reached
the initial sack but one, that being when Chase
had passed him in the nerve-racking fourth. He
was due now, as it proved, to sweeten his average,
and at the expense of Billy White, for when he
swung at Chase’s second delivery and slammed
it straight at Billy the latter made his second
error of the game. The ball went through him,
and had Brook taken advantage of his chance he
might easily have reached second. As it was,
though, he hesitated at first and Collins, who had
come in fast on the ball, pegged promptly to
Wayne and Brook was forced to scuttle back to
safety.</p>

<p>East laid down a sacrifice bunt and retired, but,
with only one man gone and the speedy Brook on
second, Toonalta’s chance to pull the game up
high and dry looked bright. But when Burns had
hit to Jim Wheelock and Jim had trotted across
the bag and then held Brook at third the visitors’
stock sank again. Gore ended the suspense by
sending a high one to Hal Collins.</p>

<p>Wayne was requested to “start it up” when he
went to the plate for the last of the inning, and
the audience loudly reminded him that this was
the lucky seventh! But it wasn’t lucky for
Wayne, since, in spite of his resolve to bat for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
clean thousand, his attempt at a hit was only a
roller to Ellis and he was out before he had gone
half-way to first. Vic Despaigne fell victim to
Ellis’ skill, yielding the Toonalta pitcher his first
and only strike-out of the game, and Chase, after
nine deliveries, four of which were fouls, found
something to his liking and whanged it into right
field. It was a long one and might easily have
put him on third, but the redoubtable Browne,
he of the home-run fame, raced back to the corner
of the field and made a one-hand catch that moved
even the enemy to wild acclaim.</p>

<p>The eighth began with the Toonalta’s fifth batter
facing Chase, but by the time it had ended
five others had toed the rubber. That inning
rivalled the fourth for hair-raising suspense.
Hunt, the Toonalta catcher, began the trouble by
hitting safely between Jim Wheelock and Wayne
for one. The subsequent batsman was an easy
out, popping a fly to Chase. Rider outwaited the
pitcher and finally got a pass, advancing Hunt
to second. With two on bases and the hard-hitting
Browne coming up, the Blues’ chances might
have been bought for a penny. To make things
look more desperate, it was apparent that Pete
Chase was weakening. Jordan was hurried out
of his sweater and sent off to warm up and Hoffman
and Chase met midway between plate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
mound and conversed earnestly while the Toonalta
“rooters” howled jeers and polite insults.</p>

<p>“Play ball! Quit stalling!” “It’s got to happen!
Get through with it!” “Good-night!”
“He’s all in! Take him out! Take him out!”
“Let him stay! We like him!” “Make ’em play
ball, Mr. Umpire!”</p>

<p>Chase was for passing Browne, but Hoffman
wouldn’t consent. “Feed him high ones, Pete,”
he muttered, “and cut the corners, but, for the
love of Mike, don’t groove any!”</p>

<p>Chase nodded none too confidently and went back
to his place and Browne swung an eager bat above
his shoulder. Possibly eagerness was Browne’s undoing,
for he bit at the first one, which was almost
shoulder high and far wide of the plate, but he
only smiled when Gas asked him if he was practising
and Medfield yelled its delight. The next
offering was a ball that sent the batsman staggering
back from the plate and brought hisses and
cries of “He’s trying to hit him!” from the
Toonalta bench. Gas, though, knew that Chase
wasn’t trying anything of the sort, that the explanation
was far simpler, that, in fact, Chase was
rapidly pitching himself out and losing control.
But he only spoke more confidently than ever.</p>

<p>“Let him live, Pete! There aren’t any cigars
in this game!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>Browne scowled. “If he beans me the first
thing you know’ll be a bat alongside your head,
Fresh!”</p>

<p>“I should worry,” answered Gas pleasantly,
dropping to his knee to signal. “Come on, Pete!
Make it good, old man! Don’t waste ’em on
him!”</p>

<p>Pete did waste one, though, for the ball passed
wide of the plate. Browne laughed. “Got you
scared, haven’t I?” he jeered.</p>

<p>“Scared blue,” replied Gas. “Watch your
head this time.”</p>

<p>But the next one came with a hook and looked
good and Browne let go at it. It wasn’t labelled
“Home Run,” though, this time, for it went
straight to Vic Despaigne, back of the goal path,
and Vic took it neatly on the bound, studied the
situation, and heaved to White. Hunt was two
yards from the bag when the ball reached third
base, and, although he made a clever slide, he
should have been out. But, as before stated, this
was not Billy’s day, and Hard Luck was still
after him. Perhaps the throw was a trifle low,
but Billy should have held it, nevertheless.
But he didn’t, and while he was searching
for it around his feet Hunt slid to safety, the
bases were filled, and Toonalta was crazed with
joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Chase started badly with Ellis and put himself
two in the hole at once. At third, Hunt was
taking long leads and doing his utmost, ably assisted
by the coacher there, to rattle the Blues’
pitcher, and it looked very much as though he
was succeeding until Chase suddenly turned the
tables on him by a quick peg to White, who had
crept close to the bag unobserved. Caught two
yards off, Hunt did the only possible thing and
dug for the plate. But the ball was ahead of
him and he doubled back again. Chase and
Despaigne took a hand in the contest and in the
end Hunt, making a despairing slide for the
rubber, was ignominiously retired. Rider and
Browne reached third and second respectively
during the excitement, but, with two gone, the
situation looked far brighter.</p>

<p>Chase settled down to recover lost ground with
Ellis and managed to get a strike across. But
his next attempt failed and the score was one-and-three.
Hoffman signalled for a straight one
and held his big hands wide apart. “Put it over,
Pete! Let him hit it!” he cried. And Pete
earnestly endeavoured to oblige and failed miserably,
and the umpire waved the Toonalta pitcher to
first!</p>

<p>Bases full again, two down and the head of the
list coming to bat! Now if ever, it seemed, Chase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
should be derricked and the falling fortunes of
the Chenangos entrusted to Jordan. The spectators
demanded the change loudly, even rudely,
but Joe Taylor, out in right field, was deaf to the
inquiring looks sent him and made no sign. Even
Chase showed a desire to quit; while, over behind
third, Jordan was awaiting the summons. But
the summons didn’t come, then or later, and Pete
Chase, looking a bit bewildered, philosophically
took up his task again and turned his attention to
Brook.</p>

<p>Now, Brook, in spite of his reputation, had so
far failed to get a hit, and, as Joe explained later,
it was on this that the latter based his calculations.
Brook would, he thought, be so anxious to
deliver that he would very probably fail altogether.
Five times out of ten it is questionable
policy to put a new pitcher in when bases are
full and any sort of a hit means runs. As often
as not such a procedure proves to be jumping
from frying pan to fire. Had Toonalta chosen to
substitute a pinch-hitter for Brook, Joe was ready
to switch pitchers, but failing that he decided to
trust to Chase and, more especially, perhaps,
Hoffman. Whether Captain Taylor’s reasoning
was good or bad, in the abstract, on this occasion
it was vindicated. With one strike and two balls
on him, Brook was offered one that was just above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
his knees and square over the base, and he went
for it. And so did Hal Collins, and caught it
almost in the shadow of left field fence, and
another tragedy was averted!</p>

<p>In their half of the eighth, the Chenangos went
out in one, two, three, order, Collins flying to
centre, Wheelock fouling to third, and Taylor
being thrown out at first. In the ninth, Toonalta
tried very hard to add to her score, but, when the
first batsman was retired on an easy toss from
Chase to Jim, she lost some of her ginger. Even
Billy White’s fourth error, which put Burns on
first and seemed to pave the way for a tally, failed
to arouse the visitors to much enthusiasm. Probably
they thought they could hold their opponents
scoreless for another half-inning and were satisfied
to call it a day. Gore, however, woke them
up when he hit cleanly past Despaigne and
advanced Burns to the second station, and the
Browns’ coaches got busy again and once more
things looked dark for the home nine. But Hunt
fouled out to Hoffman—and the big catcher’s
expression as he looked at the rival backstop
was beautiful to see if you were a Chenango sympathiser!—and
the Blues’ first baseman, who had
played a star game all the afternoon, ended his
services at the bat, and incidentally the inning,
by fanning. Chase received an ovation for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
strike-out as he returned to the bench, and he
deserved it.</p>

<p>Toonalta jogged into the field with a fine confidence,
or an appearance of it. She had only to
keep the adversary from crossing the plate to
win, and since the fifth inning the Chenangos had
failed to show anything dangerous. Perhaps
the home team itself was more than doubtful of
its ability to pluck that contest from the fire,
although certainly Joe Taylor showed no sign of
dejection. Joe insisted loudly and cheerfully that
now was the appointed time, although he didn’t
use just those words. What he really said was:
“Now come on, Chenangos! Get at ’em!
Eat ’em up! Here’s where we start something!
Hit it out, Larry! Let’s get this right
now!”</p>

<p>But Colton was a disappointment, for he only
rolled one to the pitcher’s box when he tried to
bunt down first base line and was out in his tracks.
Billy White was called back once to make place
for Brewster, but even as the pinch-hitter strode
to the box Taylor changed his mind again and it
was finally the unlucky Billy who stood up at the
plate. Just how Billy managed to outguess Ellis
was a mystery, but outguess him he did, and
presently he was trotting down the path to first
base while Vic Despaigne tried to stand on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
head and <a href="#image03">every other Medfield adherent made a
joyful noise</a>!</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_182">Every Other Medfield Adherent Made a Joyful Noise</a></div>
</div>

<p>Joy, however, gave place to gloom a few minutes
later when Hoffman, after almost securing a two-bagger—the
ball only went foul by two inches—sent
a hot one straight into third baseman’s glove.
As the ball went back to the pitcher the audience
started its exodus, for with two down and the
runner no further than first, the end was discernible—or
so they thought. But what followed only
proved again the famous adage that the game isn’t
over until the last man’s out.</p>

<p>Wayne got his bat from an anxious-faced June,
a June too downhearted to even put a “conjur”
on it, listened to Taylor’s instructions to “just
meet it, Sloan, and try for the hole between first
and second,” and took his place in the trampled
dust of the box. Ellis was cautious and deliberate
and was putting everything he had on the ball.
Wayne let the first one go by and was sorry for
it, since it cut the outer corner of the plate and
went for a strike. Then Ellis tried him on a wide
one, waist-high, and followed it with a second
strike, a drop that fooled the batsman completely.
Ellis attempted to sneak one over close in, but
overdid it and the score was two-and-two, and
Wayne realised that a whole lot depended on his
judgment of the next offering. Possibly Ellis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
meant to fool Wayne with a change of pace, for
what came next was a slow one that looked tempting.
Wayne yielded to the temptation. Then he
flung his bat aside and was streaking to first
amidst the triumphant shouts of the spectators.
At first, Taylor waved him on, and Wayne circled
and dug out for second. Centre and left fielder
were on the ball together and left fielder made the
throw in, but it arrived only when Wayne was
stretched in the dust with one toe on the bag. On
third, Billy White was listening to excited instructions
from Hoffman, while, from the sides of
the field, came pæans of delight. Those spectators
who had wandered from their seats or points
of vantage fought their way back again, crowding
and pushing and questioning. Joe Taylor
was sending in Brewster for Despaigne, and
Hunt, the Toonalta catcher, in spite of his confident
reassurances to Ellis, looked disquieted.</p>

<p>On second, Wayne, mechanically slapping the
dust from his new togs, hoped hard for a hit. He
knew nothing of Brewster’s batting prowess and
wished with all his heart that Hal Collins or Jim
Wheelock was up. A hit would bring him in
from second, with White ahead of him, and win
the game. Then he was off the base, watching the
shortstop from the corner of his eye, listening
for warnings from the coach at first, ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
speed ahead or dodge back. But, with an eager
runner on third, Ellis was taking no chances.
Nor was Hunt. Once the catcher bluffed a throw-down,
but the ball only went to the pitcher, and
neither White nor Wayne was fooled.</p>

<p>Brewster looked nervous, but he didn’t act so.
He judged the first offering correctly and let it
go, started to swing at the next, changed his mind,
and heard it called a strike and held back from
the third, which dropped at the bag and almost
got away from Hunt. The shouting of spectators
and coaches was having its effect on Ellis at
last. A third ball followed. The uproar increased.
Even the base-runners added their
voices to the pandemonium of sound. Ellis
fumbled his cap, looked around the field, rubbed a
perspiring hand in the dust, took the signal very
deliberately, although it could mean but one thing
unless Hunt had decided to pass the batsman,
wound up slowly, and pitched.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would have been the part of wisdom
to have walked Brewster, under the circumstances,
but Toonalta chose otherwise and so things happened
as they did. The ball, fast and straight,
went to the plate like a shot from a gun, but
Brewster was ready for it. A fine, heartening
crack sounded over the diamond, the ball sailed
off toward left field, Billy White sprang into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
stride and Wayne lit out for third. Left fielder
came in on the run, got the ball on the first long
bounce, set himself quickly, and plugged it home.
It was a good throw and it reached Hunt only one
stride from the plate. But that one stride was
sufficient to bring victory to the Blues and defeat
to the Browns, for when Hunt fell to his knee and
swept the ball downward Wayne was stretched on
his back with one scuffed, dust-covered shoe fairly
on the rubber!</p>

<p>After that, confusion, cheering, a grinning,
white-toothed June pulling Wayne to his feet, an
influx of shouting, happy Medfieldians, amongst
them Arthur Pattern, and hands thumping Wayne
on the back as he pushed his way toward
the bench. He was breathless, dusty, and tired,
as he added his feeble voice to the cheer for the
defeated rival, but he was terrifically happy at the
same time.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>“A GENTLEMAN TO SEE MR. SLOAN”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>There was a Fourth of July entertainment at the
Y. M. C. A. that evening, and Wayne and June
stayed in town for supper and afterward walked
around to the Association building through the
warm summer night. June still talked about that
ninth inning. “Mas’ Wayne, that was surely one
fine ol’ innin’,” he declared for the tenth time.
“Lawsy-y-y, but I certainly was scared, yes, sir!
When that yere Mister Brewster grab a bat an’
walk up to that yere plate I didn’ look for nothin’
but jus’ disappointment. But he delivered the
goods, didn’ he? He certainly did! But I was
mortal ’fraid you wasn’ goin’ get home before that
ol’ ball!” June chuckled. “You surely did run
<em>some</em>, Mas’ Wayne!”</p>

<p>They found most of the other players present
when they reached the building and when it was
time to adjourn to the hall they flocked in together,
June accompanying them protestingly,
and received a round of applause as they went to
their seats. The entertainment was enjoyable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
but didn’t last long, and when it was over an impromptu
reception took place in the big lounging-room
and everyone flocked around and
said nice things about the team and the
game was played over again several times. It
was difficult to decide who the real hero of the
contest was, since so many had performed. Pete
Chase came in for a good share of praise; for
five strike-outs, three assists, and no errors was
considered a fine record against as strong a team
as the Toonaltas. The five passes that he had
issued were easily pardoned since none had resulted
in a score. In hitting, Toonalta stood
seven for a total of ten bases and Chenango nine
for a total of eleven.</p>

<p>Brewster was lauded for his rescue hit, Jim
Wheelock for his steady playing on base and at
bat, Collins for a brilliant defence of left field
and a timely two-base wallop, Hoffman for his
heady catching, and Despaigne for his work at
short. Even Billy White came in for a share of
the compliments, for Billy had worked Ellis for
a pass in the last inning and subsequently landed
the tying run. But when all was said Wayne was
really the star. He had fielded without an error,
having three assists and two put-outs to his credit,
had made three hits for a total of four bases in
four appearances at the plate, and had tallied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
winning run. In the batting line Jim Wheelock
was his nearest competitor, Jim having two hits
to his credit. In fielding Wayne had no competitor
that day. Many kind things were said about
him, and Arthur Pattern’s prediction that Wayne
would make himself heard some day as a baseman
was concurred in by all. Perhaps the Chenangos
and their admirers were a bit too lavish with their
praise that evening, but they felt exceptionally
good over the victory and may be pardoned for
indulging in what our English cousins would call
“swank.”</p>

<p>In the middle of the session of mutual admiration
word came from the office that a gentleman
was inquiring for Wayne, and Wayne wondered
who it could be and decided that Jim Mason had
at last accepted his oft-repeated invitation to the
Association. But it wasn’t Jim who awaited him.
The caller was a somewhat thick-set man of forty
with a much wrinkled face from which a pair of
shrewd, light-blue eyes peered forth from under
heavy brows. He wore a suit of gray plaid, the
coat a trifle tight across the big chest, a pair of
wonderfully brilliant tan shoes, a heavy gold
chain across his waistcoat, and a big diamond ring
on one hand, and carried a soft straw hat adorned
with a black-and-yellow scarf. Wayne didn’t observe
all these details at first, for he was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
too busy speculating as to the man’s errand, reflecting,
as he crossed to meet him, that the letter
to his stepfather had reached him well over a
week ago, allowing plenty of time for him to set
the law on his track. But the visitor didn’t quite
look the part of Authority, for he had a genial
smile and a ready expression of polite apology.</p>

<p>“This Mr. Sloan?” he asked as Wayne reached
him. Wayne acknowledged the fact. “My
name’s Farrel, Chris Farrel. Maybe you’ve
heard the name.” He held out the ringed hand
and Wayne took it, shaking his head. “No?
Well, I was before your time. I’m with the Harrisvilles,
of the Tri-State League.”</p>

<p>“Oh, baseball?” asked Wayne.</p>

<p>“Sure! Say, isn’t there a place we can sit
down a minute? I’ve got a proposition I’d like to
make you, Mr. Sloan.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” said Wayne. “I reckon
we can find a corner in the game-room. There’s
a crowd in the big room.” He led the way to a
couch in a corner that was sufficiently removed
from the few groups of chess and domino players.
“You’re a ball player?” he asked as the caller
cautiously lowered himself into place and dropped
his hat to the floor beside him.</p>

<p>“Do I look it?” inquired the other, with a
chuckle. “Say, I weigh two hundred and eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
right now. I’d make a hit, wouldn’t I, chasing
around the gravel? No, I haven’t played for six
years. I’m interested in the Badgers now. Own
a little stock and do a bit of scouting for ’em.”</p>

<p>“The Badgers?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what they call the Harrisville
team. John K. Badger, the Southern Pennsylvania
Coal Company man, is the owner: him and
Steve Milburn and me. Him owning ninety per
cent, and me and Steve dividing the rest.” Mr.
Farrel chuckled again. “Ever see our team play,
Mr. Sloan?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I haven’t been up North very long.”</p>

<p>“So a fellow was telling me. Said Georgia was
your home, I think. Well, they grow peaches
down there. Ty Cobb, for instance. Guess you’ve
heard of him, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a good many times, Mr. Farrel.”</p>

<p>“Yup, he’s some player, Tyrus is. Well, say,
we’ve got a pretty good little team over our way.
Copped the pennant two years running and
finished third last season. Had hard luck last
season. Weak in the box, too. This year, though,
we’re going nicely. Got a twelve-game lead right
now and mean to hold it. There won’t be anyone
else in it by the last of August. That’s a cinch.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, I’m sure,” murmured Wayne
politely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“We can’t miss it. We’ve got the pitchers and
the fielders and the hitters. Ever hear of Nick
Crane?” Wayne shook his head. “Thought
maybe you had. Well, Nick’s with us this year.
Got him sewed up for three seasons. And, say,
that kid can certainly pitch! You ought to have
seen him in the game with Damascus last Thursday.
Not a hit off him until the eighth, and not
a man got beyond second. Then we’ve got
Herring—played with Syracuse two years ago—Nye,
Cotton, Wainwright, and young Joe Casey.
Six mighty good lads. And we’ve got a hitting
team, too. Give me a good bunch of pitchers and
five men who can hit the pill and I’ll guarantee
to finish first two years out of three. We don’t go
in for stars much. Can’t afford them, to be
honest. What we try to get is a nice, well-rounded
team. Do you get me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so,” responded Wayne. “But—but
I’m afraid I don’t see what this has got to
do with me, Mr. Farrel.”</p>

<p>“Well, I was coming to that. Takes me some
time to get moving, I’m so heavy, you see. Here’s
the story.” Mr. Farrel lifted one ponderous leg
over the other and dropped his voice to a confidential
and husky rumble. “I’ve got a pal lives
here. Maybe you know him. H. M. Breen, of the
Sterling Spool Company. No? Well, him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
me has been pals for a long time, and his daughter
was married last night and I came over for the
shindig. Today him and me went out and saw
you fellows play ball. And, say, we saw a good
game, too. I don’t mean it was so blamed scientific—those
Toonalta guys made a lot of fool
moves: they ought to have sewn that game up in
the eighth—but it was fast and interesting. Well,
I was just passing the time, you understand, Mr.
Sloan. Wasn’t looking for any finds or nothing.
Just enjoying a day off. Get me? But ’long
about the fourth inning I began to sit up and take
notice of the fellow playing second for the Medfield
bunch. ‘He ain’t so poor,’ says I. ‘He’s
got a nice way of handling himself, he has, and
he sure can biff the ball. Course, he needs training,
but it looks to me like he had the goods.’
Well, I watched him close and I saw him dip in on
a nice double play and push the pellet around
for three hits, one of ’em a clean two-bagger,
an’ I says to myself, ‘Chris, why don’t you look
the young gentleman up and have a talk with
him?’ I says, ‘Maybe he’d think well of a chance
to get in good company and learn how to play
real ball.’ So I inquired around and found you
hung out up here a good deal and here I am.”
Mr. Farrel smiled jovially, produced a cigar from
a pocket, viewed it and replaced it with a sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s very kind of you,” stammered Wayne.
“Do you mean that—that you’ll give me a position
on your team?”</p>

<p>“Sure! That is, if you pan out like I think
you will. That’s up to you, Mr. Sloan. You see,
you’re young yet: can’t be more than eighteen,
eh?” Wayne shook his head again. There was,
he felt, no necessity of being more specific.
“Well, I’ve seen fellows play rattling ball at
eighteen and be no good at all when they were
twenty. Seemed like they just outgrew it. I ain’t
saying that’s your way. But it don’t do to
promise too much just at first. And then again,
Steve’s the man that has the last word. He’s
manager, you see, and what Steve says goes. All
I can do is send you up to him and tell him
to give you a try-out. If he likes you he’ll treat
you fair. If he don’t like you, why, there’s no
harm done, is there?”</p>

<p>“How long would he be finding out?” asked
Wayne doubtfully. “You see, sir, I wouldn’t
want to lose my job here and then get turned
down.”</p>

<p>“Two or three days. Say three, just to be on
the safe side. You get your boss to let you off
for that long, beat it over to Harrisville tomorrow
night and report to Steve Thursday morning. If
he says nothing doing you’ll be back here Saturday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
It’s only a two-hour run on the train. How
does that strike you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Wayne. “If—if the
manager liked me well enough to keep me would
I play second?”</p>

<p>“Maybe you would or maybe he’d put you
somewhere else. Maybe you’d have to wait
around awhile for a position. Our infield’s
pretty good as it is and you ain’t had the experience
you need, you see. But Steve will treat
you right, take it from me.”</p>

<p>“If I didn’t get on the team, though, would I
get paid?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Once you put your name to the contract
you get paid every month regularly whether
you play or just sit on the bench. That’s soft,
ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is, but I’d rather play, Mr. Farrel.
How much—that is—what would I get?”</p>

<p>“Salary? Oh, you and Steve would have to
fix that up. He’s no piker, though. He’ll do the
fair-and-square by you. Don’t you worry about
that.”</p>

<p>“Well, but, how much do you suppose?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to quote any figures, Mr. Sloan.
That ain’t in my job. All I do is scout. When I
see a likely looking chap I say just what I’m
saying to you. ‘Go and report to Steve Milburn,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
I says. ‘He’ll talk salary with you when you’ve
shown him what you can do.’ More than that I
ain’t got the right to say, Mr. Sloan. But we pay
good salaries as salaries go on the minors, and,
what’s more, we <em>pay</em> ’em! You don’t get promises
and an order on the grocer. Old John K. is right
there every month with the coin. He don’t waste
his money, John K. don’t, but he pays his bills.
Now what do you say, Mr. Sloan?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m much obliged to you and——”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute! Tell you what I’ll do. I
believe in you. I believe you’ll make good. Get
me? So I’ll hand you over a ten-dollar bill right
now. That’ll pay your expenses both ways. If
you make good you can pay it back to me. If you
don’t, forget it. That’s fair, ain’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but I don’t know whether I want to—to
do it. If I was sure of a chance to play and
knew what I’d earn——”</p>

<p>“You’re sure of a chance to play the very
minute you show you can play. And whatever
you get for a salary will be three or four times
what they pay you in the freight house, at least.”</p>

<p>It occurred to Wayne that Mr. Farrel had
managed to learn quite a few particulars about
him in the short space of four hours! Secretly
he was overjoyed by the prospect of joining a real
baseball team and earning money, but something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
whispered caution, and so, after a minute’s deliberation,
he said: “I’ll think it over, Mr. Farrel,
and let you know tomorrow if you’ll tell me where
I can find you.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” answered the other heartily
enough, but there was a look on his face suggesting
that he would have been better pleased had Wayne
closed with the offer then and there. “I’ll be at
the Union House until noon tomorrow. You think
it over and let me know by twelve o’clock. I was
going down to Philadelphia tonight, but I thought
maybe I wouldn’t be around here again for a
while and it mightn’t do me or you any harm if
we had a little chat. Get me? But, say, Mr.
Sloan, you take my advice and don’t talk much
about this business. And don’t let anyone con
you into signing a contract. A lot of these baseball
scouts are regular thieves. That sounds like
talking down my own business, don’t it? Well,
there’s scouts and scouts, and some of ’em’ll sign
you up hard and fast before you know what’s
happened. And when you go to look over your
contract you’re getting the core and the club’s got
the apple. See me before you talk to anyone
else, will you? Just give me an option on your
services until tomorrow noon, eh?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, sir. I don’t expect anyone else
will be after me, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I guess not. I’m only playing it safe.
You see, I’ve taken some trouble to talk with you
about this, and missed an appointment in Philadelphia
this evening, and it’s only fair for me to
get the first chance, ain’t it? You see that yourself,
I guess. Well, I’ll be moving. Don’t forget
to come around by twelve tomorrow. Ask for
Chris Farrel—F, a, r, r, e, l—in Room 28. I’ll be
looking for you. Good-night, Mr. Sloan. Much
obliged to you. Don’t trouble. I know the way
out. S’long!”</p>

<p>Mr. Chris Farrel, with a big, black cigar in a
corner of his mouth at last, and searching for
matches with an anxious hand, nodded and passed
out, leaving Wayne a prey to excitement and
incredulity.</p>

<small>PATTERN GIVES ADVICE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Wayne wanted advice, and it was to Arthur
Pattern that he went. A quarter of an hour
after Mr. Farrel’s departure Wayne and Arthur
were sitting on the steps of the State National
Bank talking it over. Now and then the sound of
exploding fireworks sounded and occasionally the
sparks of a distant rocket lighted the sky beyond
the roofs or red, white, and blue stars floated high
against the purple darkness of the night, but the
celebration was nearly over and the main street
was nearly deserted.</p>

<p>“I remember Chris Farrel,” Arthur Pattern
was saying. “That is, I remember reading about
him. He used to be a crackajack catcher some
years ago. Played for a long time with one of the
western clubs; Cincinnati, I think. Then he was
with Washington and left them to manage some
team like the Baltimores. Don’t think it was
Baltimore, though. I don’t know much about this
Harrisville outfit, but the Tri-State League’s been
going for a good many years. It’s a six-club<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
league. Harrisville and Doncaster in this state,
Paterson and Trenton in New Jersey, and Utica
and some other place in New York State.”</p>

<p>“Damascus, I think he said.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Damascus. Some of those are good baseball
towns, and they ought to make money. Still,
I don’t suppose they do much better than split
even after expenses are paid. Saturdays and
holidays are about the only times they draw big
attendances, they charge about half what the big
leagues charge for admission, and players’
salaries, travelling expenses, and so on count up
fast. Men like this Mr. Badger own ball teams
more for amusement than anything else, I guess.
Some of them go in for steam yachts, some for
trotting horses, and some for ball teams. I guess
they net about the same on the investment,” ended
Arthur drily.</p>

<p>“Then you think this Harrisville team isn’t
very good?” asked Wayne.</p>

<p>“Better than some, not so good as others. If
you’re going in for professional baseball playing,
Wayne, you’ve got to get experience, and one
team’s about the same as another, so long as you
get your salary. You can’t afford to choose and
pick, I guess, because it isn’t easy for a youngster
like you to get a try-out. If a chance comes to
you, grab it. After all, it doesn’t make much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
difference where you start. If you’re any good
you won’t stay long in the bushes. The main
question is: Do you want to be a ball player?”</p>

<p>Wayne considered in silence for a long minute.
Then: “Well, it’s like this, Arthur,” he answered
slowly. “I wouldn’t want to play ball all my
life. It isn’t good enough. But there isn’t much
I can do—yet. It isn’t as though I’d been trained
for something, like engineering or keeping books
or—or farming. I’m not good for anything at all—yet.
The only thing I can do half-way well is
play baseball. So it seems to me that it’s a
sensible thing for me to play ball and make some
money so that I can learn to do something better.
If I made some money in the summer I could go
to school or college in the winter, couldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you could. What would you like to
be?”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered the other, smiling, “I used
to think I wanted to be a locomotive engineer, but
I reckon now I’d rather be a veterinary surgeon.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed Arthur. “A horse
doctor?”</p>

<p>Wayne nodded untroubledly. “Yes, that’s what
they call them in the country,” he replied, “just
as they call the doctor a ‘sawbones.’ Don’t you
think curing sick animals is just as fine a profession
as curing sick people?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hm. Do you?”</p>

<p>“Finer. Seems to me it takes more skill. A
person who is ill can help the doctor, you see, by
telling him where the trouble lies, but an animal
can’t. The doctor has got to depend on his
knowledge altogether, hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. Still, up where I live we don’t
class the vets and the physicians together, I’m
afraid. The vets are generally rather ignorant
old chaps, I guess. I remember hearing my father
say once when I was a kid that old Nancy, the
carriage horse, was dying and that he guessed it
was time to call in the vet and let him have the
credit for it.”</p>

<p>“Did she die?” asked Wayne.</p>

<p>Arthur thought a minute. Then: “By Jove, I
don’t believe she did that time!” he laughed.
“Perhaps old What’s-his-name was some good,
after all!”</p>

<p>“Doctor Kearny—he’s the veterinarian at home—says
that the profession is making faster strides
nowadays than any other,” said Wayne. “He
says the day is past when the man who can’t make
a living any other way can become a dentist or a
veterinary surgeon. He says treating horses and
cows and dogs and things is a heap harder than
giving pills to persons. I’d rather cure a horse
or a dog any day than a human being.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“It might depend on the human being, mightn’t
it?” laughed the other. “Well, all right, old man,
you be a vet if you want to. Perhaps it is a good
deal finer trade than I’d thought. Anyway, what
we’ve got to decide is whether you’re to join the
Badgers, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I wish he’d given me some idea what
the salary would be. What do you think,
Arthur?”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t look for more than a hundred
a month at first. You see, Wayne, you aren’t anything
remarkable yet. You don’t mind my talking
plain? This man Farrel is banking on you learning
the game and turning out well in a couple of
years. He thinks that if they can get hold of you
now and sign you up at a small salary it’ll pay
them to do it on the chance that you’ll be of real
use later. I dare say there are lots of chaps who
play just about the same sort of game that you do
right now. Personally, I think you’ll make good.
You sort of—sort of—well, I don’t just know
how to say it, but you sort of <em>look</em> good. There’s
a certainty in the way you handle the ball and the
way you handle yourself that’s promising. I
guess it struck Farrel the same way. If he was
sure he could come around two years from now
and find you he wouldn’t have made a sound
today, but he isn’t. He’s afraid that someone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
else will discover you and grab you. But don’t
get it into your head that you’re a marvel, Wayne,
because you aren’t. Not yet. If you do go over
to Harrisville, old man, talk small and don’t let
your hat hurt you.”</p>

<p>“I won’t. I don’t think this has swelled my
head any. What I’m afraid of is that this
manager man won’t like me when he sees me.”</p>

<p>“That’s possible, too. Better not hope too
much. I dare say Farrel sends a lot of fellows
over there who just turn around and go home
again. But his offering to stake you to your
fares looks as if he was pretty fairly certain in
your case.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t take that money,” said Wayne
earnestly.</p>

<p>“You will if you go. I’ll see that you do. It’s
a business proposition, Wayne. Farrel’s paying
you ten dollars for an option on you. If he takes
you he gets his option money back. You mustn’t
think, though, that being a minor league ball
player is all roses. It’s no picnic. You’ll have
to practice every morning, whether you get on or
not, you’ll have to beat it around the country for
weeks at a time, sleeping on the train or in punk
hotels, you’ll get bawled out when you pull a
boner and no one will say ‘Thank you’ when you
make a star play: no one but the ‘fans,’ and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
they’ll be the first to hoot you the next day if you
make one miscue. You’ll run up against some
rough ones on the team who will probably make
life a perfect misery for you at first, and you’ll
get the short end of a lot of decisions until the
umpires see that you are real. I don’t want you
to think that minor league ball playing is all bread
and treacle, Wayne.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’ll be hard,” was the response, “but
any work is hard, isn’t it? And I’d rather do
something hard that I like to do than something
easy that I don’t. And I do like to play ball,
Arthur. Besides, a hundred dollars a month is
real money to me. If I stayed on the team three
months I’d have three hundred dollars!”</p>

<p>“Not quite, because you have to live meanwhile.
Remember that the club only pays your
bills while you’re travelling, and you’re travelling
only about half the time.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t cost me much, though, to live in
Harrisville, would it? I reckon I could find a
boarding-house pretty reasonable.”</p>

<p>“I guess so. It’s a pretty big town. Look
here, Wayne, suppose I go around there with you
tomorrow and have a talk with Farrel. Maybe
I could get him to promise something definite.
Want me to?”</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” said Wayne gratefully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
“That is, if I decide to try it. I’m going to think
it over tonight.”</p>

<p>“Well, you want to start thinking pretty soon,”
laughed Arthur, yawning as he arose, “because
it’s nearly eleven now and there isn’t much night
left for us slaves. You call me up at the office
in the morning and let me know. Then I’ll take
my lunch hour at eleven-thirty and we’ll go around
to the hotel together. Good-night, Wayne.”</p>

<p>It was close on midnight when Wayne left the
railroad track and started across the meadow
through the lush grass toward the dim orange
glow from the windows and open door of the
car. It suddenly came to him that he would be
sorry to leave this queer retreat of theirs, for it
had been more like a real home than any he had
known for several years. And, with a genuine
pang, he remembered the garden he had planted.
He would never see the flowers blossom, never see
the little green pellet, which had mysteriously
appeared on one of the tomato plants a few days
ago, grow and ripen! The thought of leaving that
garden almost determined him then and there to
think no more of Mr. Farrel’s offer, but to stay at
home with June and be satisfied with his work
and the new friends he had made.</p>

<p>June was still awake when he approached, and
hailed him across the starlit darkness. And Sam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
barked shrilly, at first with a challenge and then,
as he scuttled to meet Wayne, with delight. The
boy picked him up and snuggled him in his arms,
and the dog licked his cheek with an eager pink
tongue. “He done catch him a terrapin today,”
announced June as Wayne seated himself tiredly
on the step. “An’ he jus’ act disgusting he was
so proud.”</p>

<p>“I reckon the terrapin was just a plain, everyday
mud turtle,” laughed Wayne. “Did you
see it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he brung it home an’ put it on its
back so’s it couldn’t get away, an’ I ’most trod
on it. What’s the diff’ence between a terrapin,
Mas’ Wayne, an’ a mud turkle?”</p>

<p>“About seventy-five cents, June.”</p>

<p>“Say there is?” June was silent a minute.
Then: “What done ’come o’ you this evenin’?
I was waitin’ an’ waitin’ for you.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, June. I wanted to see Arthur
Pattern about something and we got to talking.
I—I’m thinking about leaving here, June.” Then,
sitting there in the star-sprinkled gloom, and
fighting mosquitoes, Wayne told of Mr. Farrel
and his proposition and of his talk with Arthur
Pattern; and when he had finished June
gave a joyous “Yip!” that startled Sam into
barking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ain’ I always tol’ you, Mas’ Wayne, that you
goin’ make you-all’s fortune up here? Ain’ I?”
Wayne couldn’t recall having been told anything
of the sort, but he didn’t say so. “Reckon we’s
goin’ to be mighty ’portant folkses now!” the
darkey went on. “How much money he goin’
to pay you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet. And I don’t know that I’ll
go, June. Maybe Mr. Farrel isn’t really in earnest.
I don’t see how he can be. I can’t play ball much,
June. If I——”</p>

<p>“Say you can’? Let me tell you, Mas’ Wayne,
sir, you plays ball better’n any of those other
gen’lemen, a heap better!”</p>

<p>“But playing on a real league team is different,
June. Suppose this manager doesn’t like me when
I get there?”</p>

<p>“He’s goin’ to like you! How far is this yere
place, Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p>“Harrisville? About eighty miles, I think. It’s
a pretty big place, June, and maybe I wouldn’t
like it as well as Medfield. I—I’ve got sort of
fond of this place. If I do go, I want you to look
after the garden, June. If you don’t I’m going
to tan your hide for you.”</p>

<p>“What you mean look after your garden, Mas’
Wayne? Ain’ I goin’ with you?”</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t see how you can,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Wayne troubledly. “Maybe after I get ahead a
little——”</p>

<p>“Now look yere, Mas’ Wayne! My mammy
done tell me to watch out for you, ain’ she? How
you ’spects I’m goin’ watch out for you if I ain’
with you? No, sir, Mas’ Wayne, if you goes, I
goes, an’ that’s all there is to it, sir!”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see,” evaded Wayne. “I dare say
I’ll be back by the end of the week, anyway. If
I’m not, and you want to come, I’ll send you some
money and you and Sam can follow.”</p>

<p>“You don’ have to send no money,” said
Wayne. “I got me ’most fifty dollars right now.
How much you got, sir?”</p>

<p>“Not a great deal,” owned Wayne ruefully.
“I’ve had to buy so many things that I’ve been
spending it about as fast as I’ve got it, June.”</p>

<p>“Ain’ boughten anythin’ you ain’ needed, I
reckon.” June stepped down and disappeared
around the side of the car and when he came back
he held a tin can in his hand. He rattled it
proudly. “Reckon you better take this along
with you,” he said, offering it to Wayne. “Jus’
you drap it in your pocket right now, sir, so’s you
won’ forget it.”</p>

<p>“Get out! I’m not going to take your money,”
answered the other firmly. “I don’t need it, anyway.
I’ve got twelve dollars, pretty near;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and Mr. Farrel is going to pay my fare both
ways.”</p>

<p>“I know that, Mas’ Wayne, but ’twon’ do for
you to walk in on them ball players over to this
yere place with no little ol’ picayune twelve dollars
in your pocket, no, sir! You got to put on a
heap o’ dog, Mas’ Wayne, ’cause if you don’t
they’s goin’ to think you don’ amoun’ to nothin’
’tall. Please, sir, you take it.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Wayne firmly. “I’m much obliged,
June, but I don’t need it. If they give me the
position I’ll have money of my own, you see.”</p>

<p>“Then you take half of it, Mas’ Wayne,”
pleaded June.</p>

<p>But Wayne was adamant and June had to hide
his treasure again, and after a while they went to
bed, June to slumber and Wayne to lie awake
until the sky began to brighten in the east. It
was only when the stars paled that sleep came
to him.</p>

<small>OFF TO HARRISVILLE</small></h2>
</div>


<p>At a quarter to six the next afternoon Wayne sat
in a red plush seat in the Harrisville train and
watched the outskirts of Medfield drop behind.
He had his ticket to Harrisville and return in
his pocket and nearly eighteen dollars folded
away in his old leather coin purse. His luggage
reposed beside him in a small brown paper parcel,
for he was travelling in light marching order.
For some reason, June had failed to show up at
the station to say good-bye, and Wayne was a
little bit resentful. He thought June might have
found the time to see him off.</p>

<p>It had been a busy day. Rather to his surprise,
he had awakened with the question fully decided.
He would go to Harrisville and talk with the
manager of the baseball team. Whether he stayed
or not would depend on whether he made good and
what salary was offered him. He would not, he told
himself firmly, accept less than a hundred dollars
a month. The talk with Chris Farrel had been
fairly satisfactory. Arthur Pattern had failed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
elicit any definite promise of engagement from the
scout, but he had made Mr. Farrel agree to supplement
the letter of introduction which Wayne
was to deliver with another, to be posted then and
there, presenting Wayne’s qualifications and advising
his employment. After that Wayne had
accepted the ten dollars, shaken hands with Mr.
Farrel, and returned to the freight house to apply
to Jim Mason for a three days’ leave of absence.</p>

<p>Jim had given his permission quickly enough,
but had shown little enthusiasm for the boy’s
project. Playing baseball for a living did not,
to his thinking, contrast at all favourably with
working for the railroad, and he didn’t hesitate
to say so. In fact, he was decidedly pessimistic
and gloomy until Wayne reminded him that there
was a strong possibility of his not securing the
position after he reached Harrisville. Jim
cheered up after that and chose to look on the
three days’ absence as a sort of brief vacation,
and virtually despatched Wayne with his blessing
when closing time arrived.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry about me,” he said. “I’ll
get on all right. It ain’t but two days and a half,
anyway. Just you have a good time and enjoy
yourself, son. Better come around for dinner
Sunday and tell us about your trip.”</p>

<p>Wayne promised to do this in the event of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
return, shook hands with Jim, feeling a bit guilty
and more than half hoping that the manager of the
Harrisville Baseball Club would send him home
again, and hurried off to the train. Arthur Pattern
had promised to get down to see him off if he
could do it, but evidently Arthur had had to stay
late this evening. The train was in the open
country now, running between wooded hills on
which the long, slanting rays of the setting sun
fell gloriously. He was a little lonesome and
wished he had taken Sam with him. After all,
Sam wouldn’t have been much trouble, and he
was a heap of company. And just then the door
at the front end of the car opened and in walked
June with a squirming, excited Sam in his arms!</p>

<p>June was grinning broadly, but there was something
anxious and apologetic about that grin.
After his first gasp of surprise, Wayne wanted
to be stern and severe, but he just couldn’t because
it was so good to have June and Sam there!
And, anyway, you couldn’t frown or be cross with
a delirious dog in your lap trying to lick your
face and whine his delight at the same time! And
so Wayne gave it up, and only smiled a trifle
sheepishly, and June, seeing that he was not to
be scolded, hugged himself, and grinned harder
than ever.</p>

<p>The conductor interrupted the reunion with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
request for tickets and a demand that the dog
be removed to the baggage car, and so the three
of them made their way forward and Sam was
once more secured to the handle of a trunk with a
piece of cord and Wayne and June perched themselves
alongside and so finished their journey.
June, it seemed, had at no time entertained any
notion of being left behind, but had thrown up his
job at the hotel that morning, staying only long
enough to break in one of his recently made
friends, and had then gone back to the car to
pack up. Wayne’s belongings were here in a
pasteboard box and June’s tied up in paper. “I
done fasten up the place,” said June, “an’ nail
boards over the windows, an’ I reckon if we-all
wants to go back there we’s goin’ to fin’ things
jus’ the same like we left ’em. An’ I done water
them tomatuses an’ everything too, Mas’
Wayne.”</p>

<p>“But, June, if we don’t stay in Harrisville
what will you do? You shouldn’t have thrown
up your job.”</p>

<p>June winked solemnly. “I done made a ’greement
with that nigger, Mas’ Wayne. If I comes
back he’s goin’ to get out, yes, sir, an’ I gets my
job back.”</p>

<p>“Oh! But supposing he changes his mind by
that time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then,” answered the other solemnly, “I’se
goin’ to change his face.”</p>

<p>Just before it got too dark to see, the train
began to run parallel with a broad river, and
after that, at intervals, the big stream flashed into
sight. The baggage-man was amiable and talkative
and told them much about the country they
were passing through and the city they were approaching,
giving them directions for finding a
cheap but satisfactory hotel near the station. As
Harrisville contained about fifty thousand population
the boys naturally expected to find a big place,
but when, having alighted from the baggage-car
by the simple expedient of jumping to a truck
outside the wide door, and made their way through
the crowded station to an equally crowded street,
the city proved to be larger and far more confusing
than their anticipation. Fortunately,
though, the Bemis House was in plain sight across
the way and they had soon secured a room. The
Bemis House drew no colour line, nor did it object
to a small dog if he was sort of smuggled
upstairs and kept quiet, and so the three companions
were speedily housed together in a small
and shabby but comfortable enough bedroom.</p>

<p>They didn’t stay in it long, however, for the
city lights were calling them. They had some
supper at a little restaurant near by and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
with Sam pulling ahead at the end of his improvised
leash, they set forth on exploration bent.
That was a most exciting evening, for they had
traversed no more than a half-dozen squares
when the lights and gaudy pictures of a moving-picture
theatre brought them to a stop. June
announced his intentions inside of two seconds,
and Wayne, after discovering that a dime would
purchase admittance, made no objections. For
the subsequent hour and a half they were as happy
as two boys could be, and when the “Good Night!
Come Again” was flashed on the screen and the
audience poured out June was all for seeing the
show over again and had to be literally dragged
away, Wayne assuring him that they could come
again tomorrow evening. They saw some of
the town then, but nothing short of a three-alarm
fire would have snared their attention after the
things they had witnessed on the screen, and so,
being tired and sleepy, they went back to the little
hotel and crawled into the beds.</p>

<p>Wayne’s letter of introduction to Mr. Stephen
Milburn bore the address of the Congress House,
and inquiry elicited the information that the Congress
House was far uptown and many blocks
away from their lodgings. For fear that the club
manager might get away before he could reach
him, Wayne ate a hurried and sketchy breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
at seven, entrusted Sam to June’s care, and hurried
off on foot at about the time the retail section
of the city through which his route lay was
beginning to wake up. The distance was long and
Wayne was horribly afraid that Mr. Milburn
would have had his breakfast and be off and about
the business of managing before he got to the
hotel. Consequently, he was somewhat surprised
when, on inquiring for the manager, he was told
that Mr. Milburn never saw anyone until after
breakfast.</p>

<p>“After breakfast!” repeated Wayne blankly.
“Well, what time is that, please?”</p>

<p>The clerk at the desk looked speculatingly at
the clock and yawned behind his hand. “He
usually comes down about nine,” was the reply.
“Come back at half-past and you’ll probably find
him.”</p>

<p>Wayne withdrew, wondering how Mr. Milburn
ever found time to do anything after getting up at
nine o’clock! For a while he occupied one of the
extremely comfortable chairs in the hotel lobby
and perused a newspaper that someone had discarded
there, but the street outside was by this
time humming and bustling, the morning was still
cool and the temptation to see more of Harrisville
was too strong for him. So he went out and
joined the stream on the sidewalk and loitered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
along, looking into fascinating windows and missing
little that went on. At a quarter to nine he
was some distance from the hotel and so he turned
back. But when he had walked as many squares
as seemed necessary to bring him to his destination
he failed to discover it. It dawned on him
then that he had been walking at right angles to
the street on which the hotel was situated, and
he turned back and hurried along the way he had
come. In the end he had to ask his way of a
newsboy. Whether that young rascal purposely
gave him the wrong direction or whether Wayne
misunderstood him, the result was the same. He
reached the Congress House at just twenty-five
minutes to ten by the big round clock in the lobby
and was met with the information that Mr. Milburn
had breakfasted a little earlier than usual
and had just gone out. The clerk, still yawning
delicately, could not even hazard a guess as to
the manager’s present whereabouts, and Wayne
was turning disappointedly away from the desk
when a bell boy came to his assistance.</p>

<p>“Say, Mister, you can find Mr. Milburn at
the ball park after half-past ten,” he said. “They
practises then every day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thanks,” answered Wayne. “Which way
is the park from here, please?”</p>

<p>“Out Tioga Avenue. Take any blue car going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
north. The conductor’ll tell you where to get
off. But you’ll see it yourself if you watch for
it.”</p>

<p>“Is it much of a walk?” Wayne asked.</p>

<p>“No, not more’n a mile and a half. Mr. Milburn
walks out there every morning. Go out
Prentiss Street till you come to the armory and
then turn left and follow the car tracks. You’ll
find it.”</p>

<p>“I surely will!” Wayne told himself as he
thanked the boy and went out again. “But the
next time I’ll know better than to let him get away
from me like that. When you start to do anything,
I reckon it’s a good plan to keep on
doing it.”</p>

<p>As it was still only a quarter to ten, Wayne
assured himself that he had plenty of time. But
he also assured himself that he wasn’t going to
loiter for that reason. If he could intercept Mr.
Milburn before he started to work it would, he
thought, be better. So he set forth at a good,
steady pace, asking his direction every few
squares so that he would not again get lost, and
presently found the armory and took the turn to
the left as instructed. A square farther a blue
car buzzed past him bearing the legend “Ball
Grounds,” and Wayne knew that he was right.
It was, however, a minute or two past the half-hour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
when the enclosure came into sight, and
Wayne decided that the bell boy had underestimated
the distance, possibly from kindly motives.</p>

<p>The park occupied two squares in a part of
the city given over to small, thickly clustered
dwellings. On one side the railroad tracks ran
close to the high board fence and smoke from the
engines—accompanied by cinders, as Wayne was
to learn later—billowed over onto the field whenever
the wind blew in the right—or, more accurately,
wrong—direction. The place looked
well cared for and the stands, visible above the
fence, were of steel and concrete. The ticket
windows and main entrances were closed and
Wayne went nearly to the next corner before he
found a means of ingress. And even then his way
was barred by a man who sat beside the small
door reading a paper until Wayne had exhibited
his letter.</p>

<p>“All right, Jack, help yourself,” replied the
man on guard. “He’s in the house, I guess.”</p>

<p>Wayne didn’t consider it worth while to waste
his time telling the man that his name wasn’t
Jack; which was just as well since Mike always
called everyone Jack—except Mr. Milburn and
one or two of the more important team members—and
it wasn’t at all likely that he would have
given serious consideration to the correction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Wayne passed through and found himself squarely
behind first base, with a wide expanse of not
very flourishing turf stretching away to the distant
fences which were everywhere adorned with
colourful advertisements of everything from
smoking tobacco to suspenders. Beside him on
his right was an open door leading into a structure
built under one of the stands and which he
presumed held the dressing quarters. At his
left was another stand with a similar building
beneath it. Over the door of the latter was the
word “Visitors.”</p>

<p>A tall, raw-boned youth of twenty-one or two
emerged through the open door at that moment.
He had the reddest hair Wayne had ever seen on
a human being and was fearfully and wonderfully
freckled. He was in uniform and held a ball in
one hand and a glove in the other. As he almost
ran into Wayne he could not help noticing
him.</p>

<p>“’Lo, Bill!” he said. “Lookin’ for someone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, Mr. Milburn.”</p>

<p>The red-haired chap jerked the hand holding
the ball over his shoulder. “Steve? He’s inside
bawling ’em out. That’s why I beat it. If you
want to sell him anything or strike him for a
pass, kid, take my advice and don’t do it. Let
him simmer down. Can you catch?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Wayne nodded. “I’ve got a letter to him,”
he said uncertainly and questioningly.</p>

<p>“Keep it, Bill, till he recovers,” advised the
other. “Come on out and catch a few for me. I
got a bum wing this morning for fair.”</p>

<p>Doubtfully, Wayne followed the big chap
around to the front of the stand. He didn’t like
the idea of delaying his interview, but it seemed
possible that the red-haired man knew best. The
latter pointed to a scarred place in the turf in
front of which a stone slab did duty for a plate.
“Stand there, Bill. Haven’t got a glove, have
you? Well, I’ll just toss ’em. I got to limber
up or Steve’ll be riding me, too, in a minute.” He
swung an arm up and sped the ball slowly and
easily across the trampled grass to Wayne and
Wayne tossed it back again.</p>

<p>“Guess you’re a player, ain’t you?” asked the
big pitcher. “Looking for a job, are you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Farrel sent me over here to see Mr.
Milburn.”</p>

<p>“So Chris is at it again, eh?” The red-haired
one eyed Wayne with more interest as he waited
for the ball to come back. “Where’d he find
you, kid?”</p>

<p>“Medfield, sir.”</p>

<p>“Medfield? Have they got a club there? What
league’s that? The Nile Valley?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s just an amateur club,” replied Wayne.
“It isn’t in any league.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it, eh? Well, say, Chris is catching
’em young, ain’t he? What was you doing when
he caught you?”</p>

<p>“I played second on the Chenango team
and——”</p>

<p>“On the <em>what</em>?”</p>

<p>“On the Chenango team, sir.”</p>

<p>“Think of that! You played second base for
’em, eh? Bet you they was the proud bunch!”</p>

<p>Wayne coloured. “Maybe you’d better find
someone else,” he said stiffly, rolling the ball back
and turning away.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on, kid!” called the pitcher, with a
good-natured laugh. “Have a heart! I wasn’t
saying anything, was I? Gee whiz, if you stay
around here you’ll get a lot worse ragging than
that, believe me! And if you know what’s what,
Bill, you’ll take it smiling, ’cause if you don’t
they’ll make it worse for you. Just hold a few
more now, like a good feller. Dan’ll be out in a
minute.”</p>

<p>Wayne nodded and spread his hands again.
This time the ball came in with a thud that almost
staggered him and the pitcher grinned. “Too
bad, kid,” he said. “I won’t do it again.”
Wayne smiled, too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“You may if you’ll tell me before you do it,” he
answered.</p>

<p>“Say, I’ll bet you can hold down a sack all
right, Bill,” replied the other. “Tell you what.
You wait for me to give you the signal, see?
When I see that Steve’s got his temper back I’ll
pipe you off. But don’t you tackle him before.
Here they come now. Thanks, kid. Keep out of
the way awhile.”</p>

<p>Wayne tossed the ball back, nodded and loitered
aside as the players emerged from the dressing-room.
Wayne thought them a very likely-looking
lot as they made their way around to the bench,
followed by a man lugging two big bat-bags. In
age they ran from nineteen to thirty, he judged.
One, a broad-shouldered and powerful-looking
man, appeared even older than thirty and wore a
heavy mustache, something that none of the others
had. The big man looked decidedly cross, Wayne
thought, and he wondered if he had been the
principal object of Manager Milburn’s wrath.
The manager himself Wayne failed to see. No
one paid any attention to Wayne. All the players
looked very grave and solemn, but Wayne caught
one, a youth not much older than he, winking at
a companion and concluded that the solemnity
was largely assumed. It was the man with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
mustache who took command of the situation just
then.</p>

<p>“Now show some pep!” he barked. “Get out
there and act alive. Some of you stuffed sausages
will be benched mighty quick if you don’t wake
up, and I’m giving it to you square. Ten dollars
a month would buy the lot of you if anyone made
the offer!”</p>

<p>Wayne awoke to the fact that the mustached
man was Mr. Steve Milburn, something he had
not suspected, since he had thought to find the
manager in street clothes. Wayne viewed his
angry countenance with sinking heart. The big
pitcher was right, he concluded. This was no
moment to approach Mr. Milburn with the expectation
of getting a hearing. He made himself
as small and inconspicuous as he might, finding a
seat on the empty bench, and for the ensuing half-hour
watched the Harrisville Badgers go through
their morning practice.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
TURNED DOWN!</h2>
</div>


<p>The practice wasn’t much different from what
the Chenangos were accustomed to. Harrisville
showed more certainty and ease and speed in
handling the ball, and there were fewer slip-ups,
but, on the other hand, Wayne thought there was
something rather perfunctory about the work.
Manager Milburn was after his charges every
minute, barking and snarling, and nothing appeared
to please him the least bit in the world.
Wayne began to wonder whether it would not be
the part of wisdom to take himself off and let the
interview wait until after dinner or even tomorrow.
There came no sign from the red-haired
pitcher—his name appeared to be Herring, according
to the irate manager, and “Red,” if you
believed the players—who was working out near
by in company with three other twirlers and two
catchers. Manager Milburn was behind the plate
and the rest of the players, with the exception of
two, were in the field. The two took turns at
batting, laying down bunts, cracking out liners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and arching long flies at the behest of the
manager. A short, stocky youngster named Nye
was pitching. It was interesting enough and
Wayne would have enjoyed it had it not been for
that letter in his pocket toward which his hand
strayed every minute or two.</p>

<p>After a while Nye gave way to one of the batters,
who, it appeared, was also a pitcher, and
retired to the bench beside Wayne. Several not
over-clean towels draped an end of the seat and
Nye seized one and patted the perspiration from
his streaming face.</p>

<p>“Getting hot,” he said to Wayne. The latter
agreed. “Newspaper man?” asked the pitcher.
Wayne shook his head. “Thought I didn’t know
your face. What’s your line, friend?”</p>

<p>“I’m after a place on the team,” replied the
boy. “Mr. Farrel sent me.”</p>

<p>“Honest? How old are you?”</p>

<p>Wayne hesitated an instant. Finally, however,
since he had a fondness for the truth, he told it.
The pitcher raised his brows.</p>

<p>“Well, if Steve asks you you’d better tack on a
couple of years,” he advised. “You look like
you might be eighteen, easy. Where do you
play?”</p>

<p>“Second, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, you aren’t likely to get there this season.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Jones is as good as they make ’em. Seen him
yet?”</p>

<p>“Jones?”</p>

<p>“No, Steve Milburn.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, not yet. He didn’t seem to be in
very good humour and so I thought maybe I’d
better wait awhile.”</p>

<p>“Hop” Nye chuckled. “You got it about right,
kid. If I was you I’d beat it and come around tomorrow.
He won’t get any better today, I guess.
Not this morning, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Is he always like—like he is now?” asked
Wayne anxiously.</p>

<p>“Steve? No, this is a little extra. Some of
the boys went off to a picnic night before last and
yesterday we got licked to a fare-ye-well by the
‘Billies.’ Oh, no, Steve has his fits now and
again, but we don’t mind ’em much, and he gets
over ’em. He’s a good sort—for a manager.”</p>

<p>At that moment a stout man wearing a faded
sweater whose alternate rings of red and white
added to his apparent circumference and who
walked with a rolling gait and chewed gum fast
and furious, appeared on the scene and was
instantly pounced on by Mr. Milburn.</p>

<p>“Where have you been, Jimmy?” demanded
the manager irately. “Had your dinner yet? Or
are you just up from breakfast?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s my usual time, Steve,” was the placid
reply. “Got through with ’em?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m through with them.” The manager’s
tone implied that he was vastly relieved. “Take
them, and if you can do anything with them, do
it for the love of mud!”</p>

<p>“All right, Boss. Over to the net, boys. Bring
them bats, some of you. Get a hustle on now.
Some of you look like you was falling asleep on
your pedals. Get goin’, get goin’!”</p>

<p>The players moved off with more or less alacrity
to the further side of the field where two batting
nets were set, and the manager, after watching
them a moment with the utmost contempt, turned
toward the bench and caught sight of Wayne. The
latter wished then that he had acted on Nye’s advice
and left the field when he had had the chance.
Steve Milburn strode up to him belligerently.</p>

<p>“What are you doing in here?” he barked.
“Who let you in? Don’t you know you fellows
aren’t allowed in here without permission? Get
out and stay out!”</p>

<p>Wayne found himself on his feet. There was
something extremely compelling in the manager’s
voice and manner! But the next instant his
fingers had closed around that letter and he was
pulling it forth from his pocket. “I—I was sent
to see you, sir——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“See me at the hotel then. You newspaper
fellows make me sick, anyway. Who sent
you?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Farrel.”</p>

<p>“Farrel? Who’s Farrel?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Chris Farrel, sir. He told me—he gave
me——”</p>

<p>“Chris sent you? What have you got there?”</p>

<p>“A letter.” Wayne offered it and the manager
pulled it impatiently from his hand, tore open
the envelope, and ran a quick and frowning gaze
over the contents. Then he squeezed letter and
envelope into a tight ball and tossed them under
the bench.</p>

<p>“He’s a fool! I don’t need infielders, and he
knows it. Nothing doing, kid.”</p>

<p>“But—he said you’d give me a try-out, sir,”
exclaimed Wayne with a sinking heart.</p>

<p>“He’d tell you anything. Look here, now, and
get this. I don’t need infielders and wouldn’t sign
one up if he was a Baker and a Collins all rolled
into one. I told Chris to find me an outfielder
who could hit and he goes and sends me a second
baseman! And robs the nursery, too! The man’s
crazy! You might as well beat it, kid. Back
to the crib for yours.”</p>

<p>“I’m old enough to play ball, sir,” answered
Wayne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing doing,” replied the man wearily.
“I can pick them up any day like you.”</p>

<p>“But he said you’d give me a try-out, Mr.
Milburn. He—he promised me that. He wrote
another letter to you yesterday——”</p>

<p>“He <em>said</em> he did. He’d tell you anything. What
would you expect of an idiot who will ship you a
second baseman when you want an outfielder?
Anyway, I haven’t got any letter. And it
wouldn’t matter if he wrote me a dozen. I’ve
got all the second baseman I want. So don’t
stand there and argue about it. I know what I
want, don’t I?”</p>

<p>“I reckon you do,” answered Wayne, losing his
temper at last. “And I know I was promised
a try-out by your—your representative”—the
manager sniffed audibly—“and I want it!”</p>

<p>“What do I care what you want?” demanded
the man loudly. “You won’t get any try-out from
me, and I’m telling you right. I’m not responsible
for Chris Farrel making a fool of himself.
Anyway, you aren’t old enough. Come around
next year and I’ll give you a try-out—for bat-boy!”
Steve Milburn turned on his heel.</p>

<p>Several retorts, none of which were either tactful
or likely to aid his cause, sprang to Wayne’s
lips, but he closed his teeth on them. Instead, he
strode quickly after the manager, and the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
turned upon him scowlingly. “Listen to me, kid,”
he said threateningly. “You beat it out of here
before I throw you out. Get that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Wayne unflinchingly.
“I’m going. Can I see you at your hotel this
evening?”</p>

<p>“You can not! I’ve said everything. Want
me to sing it for you?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, only I thought that maybe you’d feel
different when you’d——”</p>

<p>“When I’d what?”</p>

<p>“When you’d got your—when you weren’t
angry, sir.”</p>

<p>“Angry? Who says I’m angry? I’m not
angry. You can’t make me angry.” Mr. Milburn
scowled alarmingly. “Anyway, wouldn’t a bunch
of boneheads like those over there make anyone
angry? I’d like to see anyone keep sweet-tempered
with that bunch of ivory-domed, flat-footed,
slab-sided cripples on his hands. There isn’t a
ball player in the lot! Not a single, solitary one!
They don’t know ball from beans, and they don’t
want to! Angry! Great Scott——”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t you want to hire a ball player,
then, sir?” asked Wayne innocently.</p>

<p>“Hire a——” Mr. Milburn sputtered and
waved impotent hands about his head. Then:
“<em>Get out!</em>” he bawled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Wayne went. There didn’t seem anything to be
gained by driving the manager to new heights of
frenzy. The last he saw of Steve Milburn that
much-tried man was legging it across the field as
fast as his feet would carry him. Wayne smiled.
“I’m glad I’m not one of those fellows,” he
thought as he turned to the gate.</p>

<p>Mike, who had moved his chair into the shade
and was dozing over his newspaper, looked up
sleepily and nodded as Wayne passed through the
fence. Outside, the smile faded from the boy’s
face. The humour had quite gone from the situation
now. He had failed and there was nothing to
do but go back to Medfield. The thought didn’t
please him. To be sure, he had prepared Jim
Mason and the others for his return by a prediction
that he wouldn’t make good, but it came to
him now that he hadn’t believed in that prediction,
that, deep down inside of him, he had all along
expected to succeed. No, returning to Medfield
didn’t appeal to him a bit.</p>

<p>Presently, as he walked along in the full glare
of a merciless noonday sun, anger ousted dejection.
Steve Milburn had no right to turn him
down like that. The club’s scout had guaranteed
him a try-out and the manager ought to give it
to him. Wayne told himself that several times,
and the more often he said it, the more convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
he became of the truth of it, until, having reached
the armory corner and turned toward the Bemis
House, he was in a condition of perspiration and
indignation. Sight of the Congress House crystallised
the indignation into resolution. He had
a right to a fair trial and he would have it. He
would have it if he stayed in Harrisville all
summer!</p>

<p>From that verdict to reckoning up his money and
comparing the amount to the requirements of a
prolonged sojourn in the city was a short step. He
had a little over ten dollars left, or would have
when he had paid for his room at the hotel, and ten
dollars would not, he reflected, keep two hungry
boys and a dog from starvation very long. Then he
remembered June’s savings and cheered up again.
Using June’s money was something he didn’t like
to do, something he wouldn’t do under ordinary
circumstances, but this was no ordinary crisis.
Wayne felt that justice and honour were involved.
He was standing up for his rights. June’s money
should be used, if necessary, for the Cause!</p>

<p>He wondered whether it might not be well to
apply to the law for assistance, but he abandoned
that idea quickly. Lawyers were, as he had
always heard, expensive helpers. And, besides,
what was the good of a try-out if nothing came
of it? And if he antagonised Mr. Milburn too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
much nothing would come of it. All the manager
needed to do was to give him the try-out and say
that he didn’t suit. Next Wayne thought of the
owner of the club, Mr. John J. Badger. Or was
it John K.? He might seek Mr. Badger and put
the situation up to him. But then, that, too, would
increase the manager’s ire and probably accomplish
harm rather than good. No, what was to
be done must be done tactfully, if firmly, he decided.
He must persuade Mr. Milburn to give
him the try-out of his own free will. Only,
how?</p>

<p>He was still confronted by that “How” when
he reached the Bemis House and found June and
Sam dozing in a tilted-back chair under the
striped awning in front. Wayne dragged a chair
alongside and, defeating Sam’s attempts to crawl
into his arms, narrated the story of the morning’s
encounter—and defeat. June was incredulous,
outraged, indignant. He insisted that Wayne
should revenge himself instantly on Mr. Milburn
and the Harrisville Baseball Club by shaking the
dust of the place from their feet and leaving
manager and team to get along without his services.
But Wayne said no to that.</p>

<p>“We’re going to stay right here until I get
what I came for,” he declared stoutly. “We’re
going to find a place to live first of all. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
too expensive, I reckon. How much money have
you got, June?”</p>

<p>“I got forty-seven dollars an’ ninety-three
cents,” replied June proudly. “I reckon that’ll
keep us here mos’ all summer, Mas’ Wayne, if
that fool man don’ give you that position before.”</p>

<p>“All right, June. Now I’m going to write a
letter. Then we’ll have some dinner and try to
find a boarding-house afterward. You stay here,
Sam.”</p>

<p>The letter, written at one of the sloping desks
that lined a wall in the little hotel lobby, was short
but decided. It was addressed to Jim Mason and
announced that Wayne would not be back to his
job but was going to remain in Harrisville. It
didn’t go into details at all and it ended up with
thanks to Jim for his kindness and love to Mrs.
Mason and Terry and a promise to see him the
first time he returned to Medfield. He considered
writing to Arthur Pattern, too, but decided to
wait for a day or two longer. Then, having
burned his bridges behind him, Wayne accompanied
June to a nearby restaurant and ate a
very satisfactory dinner.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>“BADGERS” VS. “BILLIES”</small></h2>
</div>


<p>They found a boarding-place without difficulty
less than a square from the hotel. It was not very
prepossessing and even June was inclined to turn
up his nose at it. However, June’s nose was not
shaped for turning-up purposes, and Wayne reminded
him that they couldn’t expect much for
two dollars and a half a week, and so he didn’t.
They engaged a small and illy-lighted little apartment
with one very grimy window that looked
out into the rear premises of an iron foundry.
The view, while not exactly inspiriting, was at
least not monotonous, for the foundry provided
movement and noise; to say nothing of smoke.
Their landlady was frowsy and sleepy-looking
and toddled away in evident relief the instant
Wayne had deposited the first week’s board money
in her hand, leaving them to debate whether the
one small towel was intended to serve both occupants.
The furniture consisted of two narrow
cots pushed side by side, one chair, a decrepit
bureau, and a metal washstand. There was a
tattered rug on the floor and an equally tattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
sash curtain at the lone window. (The rug was
tossed into the hallway that night after Wayne
had caught his foot in a hole and fallen against
the bureau.) The cots looked ready to collapse
of their own weight, but proved equal to the tasks
set them, although they complained horribly every
time Wayne or June turned over in them.</p>

<p>But that was later. After settling their few
belongings into place the boys, followed, you may
be certain, by Sam, sallied forth again. It was
mid-afternoon by that time and Wayne led the
way hurriedly along the street in the direction of
the distant ball park. To part with fifty cents of
their combined fortunes seemed, on the face of
it, pure recklessness, but Wayne soothed his
conscience by telling himself that a fellow ought
to know something about the ball team he was
going to join. June’s conscience troubled him
not a whit. June was as pleased as Punch at the
idea of seeing a ball game. Sam—well, we don’t
know what Sam thought about it. He seemed,
however, perfectly willing to accompany the expedition.</p>

<p>The game was well into the first half of the
third inning when the two boys settled themselves
in their places on the bleachers. There had been
a trifle of difficulty in persuading the man at the
gate to allow the passage of the dog, a difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
which Sam had solved by taking the matter under
his own control and trotting past. The ticket taker
had threatened to have the dog removed, but his
threat had seemed to lack conviction and the boys
were not troubled. Wayne was surprised to note
the smallness of the attendance. The reserved
sections were merely sprinkled with spectators
and more than half of the bleacher seats were
empty. Possibly six hundred persons were on
hand, but surely no more.</p>

<p>The Doncaster Club, familiarly known as the
“Billies,” were the opponents this afternoon,
playing the third contest of a four-game series.
The score-board showed Doncaster leading by
two runs obtained in the first inning. Wayne
squandered another five cents and bought a score-card
which informed him of the batting order. A
neighbour ended his doubt as to which of the three
pitchers on the card was really performing by
telling him over his shoulder that “Wainwright’s
in the box and Linton’s catching. They worked
him for a pass and a three-bagger in the first.
Henderson and Coe’s the Billies’ battery.”
Wayne thanked him and turned his attention
back to the game in time to see the third Doncaster
man thrown out at first.</p>

<p>After that the game dragged for several
innings, with neither team getting past second.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Wayne recognised several of the players he had
watched in the morning, notably O’Neill, the
lanky, tow-headed left fielder, and a small, lithe
youngster named Bennett who played third base
as if he had a bunch of steel springs inside him.
In spite of the distance to the bench, Wayne easily
made out Steve Milburn and “Red” Herring and
thought the smaller man next to “Red” was Nye.
The crowd in the bleachers kept up an incessant,
good-natured flow of comment and advice. O’Neill—Wayne
learned before the game was over that
his popular nickname was “Sailor”—was a great
favourite with the bleacherites and frequently
turned to wave a hand or shout a pat reply to
some remark aimed at him. The bleacherites had
other favourites as well: young Bennett and Nick
Crane, the first-choice pitcher, and a swarthy,
broad-shouldered, long-limbed first baseman
named Morgan. And Wayne gathered in the
course of the contest that Steve Milburn was
held in the utmost respect as a manager and was
personally popular to a degree.</p>

<p>Wayne thought that the manager’s “bawling-out”
that forenoon had done good, for the Harrisville
team was certainly on its toes all the time
and played with a snap. Only the total inability
to hit the Billies’ pitcher safely kept the home
club from scoring. Henderson was slammed here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
there, and everywhere, but there was always a
man right on the spot to spoil the hit. However,
the Badgers did manage to get a run across in the
fifth when Cross, who played shortstop and captained
the team, beat out a roller to first, was
sacrificed to second, and won home on a long fly to
right fielder. But Doncaster came back in the next
inning and found Wainwright for two hits and
a sacrifice and took back her lead of two tallies.</p>

<p>June was having a fine time with a bag of
peanuts, which he shared with Sam, and was already
a violent partisan of the Harrisville
Badgers. His comments, voiced for Wayne’s ear
alone but audible to the nearby spectators,
aroused much mirth. Wayne didn’t hear them
all, for he was busy watching the players and
their methods. He saw several tricks that were
new to his experience. For instance, a Doncaster
coach at third insisted that a runner who had
reached that base should keep outside the foul
line, something that the runner repeatedly neglected
to do. That puzzled Wayne for the better
part of two innings and wasn’t solved until a
batter hit sharply to young Bennett, whereupon
Wayne realised that had a runner been on fair
ground he would probably have been hit by the
ball and so been put out. By keeping on foul
territory he was safe. He stored the fact away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
in his memory for future use. Most of all he
watched the playing of Jones, the second baseman.
Jones was short and a bit heavy-looking,
but he seemed fast enough in action and certainly
played a good, steady game. At bat he was not
dangerous that afternoon, but, for that matter,
none of the Badgers was. Wayne asked the man
behind him, who had volunteered the information
about the batteries, what sort of a hitter
Jones was and the man pursed his lips and
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Clover Jones? We-ell, he ain’t so bad as some.
He bats better’n Tim Leary. I’ve seen Clover
everlastingly wallop the ball an’ then again I’ve
seen him go a week without making a hit. You
can’t tell about Clover. He’s a good baseman,
though. Ain’t anybody hitting today. That
feller Henderson’s got a lot on the ball, I guess.”</p>

<p>But even Henderson, who ranked high in the
Tri-State League, couldn’t keep it up to the end,
and when the eighth inning came Sailor O’Neill
brought yelps of joy from the stands by leading
off with the Badgers’ fourth safe hit of the game,
a sharp liner that whizzed over shortstop’s head
and let O’Neill reach second base by a hair’s
breadth. Then Leary struck out. Linton, the
catcher, laid down a bunt in front of the plate and
the Billies’ backstop chose to head off O’Neill at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
third. But his hurried throw went wide, O’Neill
scored and Linton slid into second. With but one
down there was a fine chance of evening up the
score or winning, and Wayne wasn’t surprised
when the delay at the plate resulted in the arrival
there of a pinch-hitter in the person of Fawcett, a
substitute outfielder. Fawcett’s appearance was
greeted joyfully by the bleachers and he received
a deal of advice. Fawcett, however, failed to
deliver the needed hit, for, after swinging at two
good ones and missing them, he stood idle, while
a third sailed across the plate. Bennett was the
remaining hope, and Bennett came across nicely.
He allowed Henderson to put him in the hole to
the tune of two-and-one, refused a wide one and
a drop, and then connected with the next offering
and banged it hard at the hole between second
and shortstop. The pitcher nearly reached it but
failed, and the ball sailed serenely over the second
bag and Linton scuttled home with the tying run.</p>

<p>The inning ended when Briggs, centre fielder,
flied out to first baseman, and with the score three
to three the game went through the ninth and
started the tenth. By this time ennui was no
longer discernible in stands or bleachers.
Leather-lunged “fans” were appealing wildly to
the Fates for a victory. Cotton was the relief
pitcher for the Badgers, and, although he was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
wild as a hawk in the ninth, he got by with the aid
of sharp fielding and settled down in the tenth
very nicely. With two of the Billies gone, though,
an error by Captain Cross gave a life to the Doncaster
left fielder and a pass to the succeeding
batsman put him on second. Then the first baseman
succeeded where better batters had failed and
lined one past third, allowing the left fielder to
score and putting the next man on second. A
fly to the outfield brought the end.</p>

<p>But Doncaster again held the lead and it was
up to Harrisville to get a run across. The
bleacherites did all they could to help, and June’s
was a conspicuous voice amongst them. Even
Sam seemed to sense a desperate crisis, for he
roused himself from the lethargy produced by
a feast of peanuts and barked wildly. Cross went
out, third to first. “Cob” Morgan, the dark-visaged
first baseman, reached the initial station
safely by reason of a fumble on the part of shortstop.
Jones started to the plate but was recalled
and LaCroix took his place. LaCroix was a thick-set,
hook-nosed Canuck. Opinion in Wayne’s
vicinity differed as to the advisability of putting
“Nap” in, but it was generally conceded that
Steve Milburn generally pulled the trick and that
events might vindicate his judgment in this case.
And events surely did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Nap LaCroix leaned against the first offering
and hit to short right and there were two on. The
Harrisville “rooters” cheered and yelped and,
considering their scarcity, made a brave uproar.
Possibly it had its effect on Henderson, for he
wabbled for the first time in the proceedings and
walked O’Neill. The bleacherites arose to their
feet and waved hats and coats and newspapers
madly. Wayne did his share, June yipped, and
Sam, squirming in Wayne’s arms, barked
frantically. Another pinch-hitter was sent in,
this time in place of Leary.</p>

<p>“O you Joe Casey!” bellowed the audience.
“Hit it out, Joe!” “Remember yesterday, Joe!”</p>

<p>The young pitcher, who Wayne gathered had
been ingloriously hammered the preceding afternoon,
didn’t look like a likely candidate to pull
the game out of the fire, for he presented a very
awkward appearance at the plate. But he didn’t
have much chance to show his prowess for Henderson
pitched two balls before he got a strike over
and then followed with two more, forcing in the
tying run and exiling himself to the showers.
The audience shouted joy and relief and settled
down to their seats again. But they still sat on
the edges, for the game was still to win. Linton
tried hard to deliver but only hit across the infield
to shortstop and LaCroix was an easy out at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the plate. The new pitcher for Doncaster was
slow and heady and he was cutting the corners
very nicely, it seemed, for he wafted two strikes
over on Cotton before the Badgers’ box artist
knew what was happening, and Harrisville saw her
hopes descending. Still, in the end Cotton almost
came through. With the score two-and-two, he
met a straight one and lifted it gloriously against
the sky for what looked like a circuit hit. Harrisville
arose as one man and shouted hoarsely and
triumphantly, for that ball looked exactly as
though it meant to ride right on over the left
field fence. The fielder hiked back on twinkling
feet, looked over his shoulder, raced on again,
turned, stepped back until his shadow loomed
large against the boards behind him, and put up
his hands. And that deceitful ball just came
right down into them as though pulled there by
an invisible string!</p>

<p>Gloom and disgust possessed the stands!</p>

<p>The sun was gone behind the hills in the west
when the eleventh session opened and the heat of
the afternoon was giving place to the coolness of
evening. Coats which had laid across knees for
ten long innings were donned again. Here and
there a spectator arose, unwillingly, and, with
long backward looks, took himself homeward.
Cotton was pitching fine ball now and Doncaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
had never a look-in during her half of the eleventh.
But neither had Harrisville in her portion. If
Cotton was going well, so was the rival twirler,
and the nearest thing to a hit that either team
evolved was a palpable scratch that placed Cross
on first, from which sack he failed to move. In
the twelfth the Billies caused consternation by
working Cotton for a pass and advancing a man
to third on a sacrifice and an error by LaCroix,
playing second. But two strike-outs followed and
averted calamity.</p>

<p>Manager Milburn’s line-up was a rather
patched affair by now, for he had staked all on
that tenth inning crisis. Fawcett started off by
flying out to left. O’Neill hit for one. LaCroix
fouled out to catcher. O’Neill stole on the second
pitch to Linton and was safe. Linton fouled
twice behind third base, each time barely escaping
being caught out, and then, with two strikes and
two balls against him, waited and walked to base.
With two on and Cotton at bat anything might
happen—or nothing. For a while it looked like
nothing, for Cotton, in spite of his eagerness to
hit and the wild and weird manner in which he
swung his bat around his head, for all the world
like a joyous lad twirling a shillalah at Donnybrook
Fair and daring an adversary to step up
and have his head broken, the Billies’ pitcher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
managed to sneak them across in unexpected
places until the score was two-and-two. Cotton
was losing his temper now, and Wayne could hear
Steve Milburn barking at him from the bench.
A third ball went past. The bleachers stormed
and railed at the Doncaster pitcher, Cotton
squeezed his bat harder than ever and did a little
dance in the box. The Billies’ twirler wound up,
shot his arm forward and the ball sped to the
plate. Perhaps Cotton mistook the ball for the
pitcher’s head. At all events, he tried hard to
break his bat on it and came near to doing it.
Off whizzed the ball and off sped Cotton. But
the long fly, while it started fair, soon broke to the
left, and Cotton, pounding the turf between first
and second with head down and legs twinkling,
was stopped in his mad career and headed back to
the plate. The audience groaned its disappointment
and sat down again. Then an unlooked-for
event occurred. Wayne was apprised of it first
when a wild burst of delight broke from his
neighbours in the bleachers. At the plate Cotton
was walking sadly toward the bench, the umpire,
mask off, was shouting something that Wayne
couldn’t hear for the noise about him and a new
figure strode to the batter’s box.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” asked Wayne to the bleachers at
large.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>“Steve himself!” was the answer. “Bust it,
Steve! Knock the hide off it! Wow!”</p>

<p>And sure enough it was Manager Milburn who
faced the Doncaster pitcher now and who tapped
a long black bat gently on the rubber, leaned it
against his leg, moistened his hands and rubbed
them together, took up the bat again and eyed
the moundsman warily. In the outfield the players
were stepping back and still back. The Harrisville
rooters shouted and screeched, red of face,
entreating of voice.</p>

<p>One ball, far wide of the plate, that Steve Milburn
only looked at as it sped by. A strike that
caused him to turn and observe the umpire silently
and derisively. Another ball, high and on the
inside, that sent Steve’s head and shoulders jerking
back from its path. The pandemonium increased.
Another offering that would have cut
the outer corner of the plate knee-high had not
Manager Milburn’s bat been ready for it. A
fine, heartening <em>crack</em> of wood and leather, a gray
streak cutting the shadows of the first base stands,
cries, pounding feet, dust, confusion and—victory!
The ball passed second baseman a yard
from his outstretched fingers and went to right
fielder on its first long bound. But right fielder
never threw it. Instead, he merely trotted benchward.
For O’Neill was throwing himself across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the plate by that time and Milburn was on first
and the game was over! And Harrisville had
avenged yesterday’s defeat to the tune of four to
three!</p>

<p>The stands emptied, the players thronged to
the dressing-rooms and Wayne and June journeyed
across the trampled field of battle on their
way to the gate as happy as though they themselves
had won that victory. And Sam trotted
behind with his pathetic stub of a tail wagging
proudly.</p>

<small>WAYNE LENDS A HAND</small></h2>
</div>


<p>That evening Wayne went to the Congress House
and inquired for Mr. Milburn. The clerk at the
desk pushed a card toward him and he wrote
his name on it. Five minutes later a bell boy
returned with the message that the manager declined
to see him. As Wayne had expected just
that, he was not disappointed. Finding a vacant
chair against a wall of the lobby, he went on watch.
But, although he saw several of the Harrisville
players come and go during the succeeding hour,
the manager did not appear, and at half-past nine
Wayne returned to the new lodgings. June, with
Sam curled into a tight bunch on his chest, was
stretched on his bed reading an evening paper.
June was not a fast reader but he was most
thorough, and one newspaper generally lasted him
for several days. Wayne made him lay his paper
aside for the present and produce what money he
had. To it Wayne added his own wealth and they
then counted it over. They had to count it thrice
for the result was different the first two times.
Fifty-five dollars and forty-one cents was what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
they finally made it. Then Wayne figured on the
margin of June’s paper and, after much frowning
and muttering, decided that by rigid economy
they could live just about five weeks on their
capital.</p>

<p>“Fifteen cents apiece is enough for breakfast
and supper,” said Wayne, “and we can get a
good dinner for thirty cents. That comes to one
dollar and twenty cents a day, or eight-forty a
week. Then two and a half for the room makes
it ten-ninety, and ten-ninety goes into fifty-five
forty five times and leaves ninety cents over.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” assented June, “but we’d better
leave us enough to get home on, Mas’ Wayne.”</p>

<p>“We’re home now,” replied Wayne firmly.</p>

<p>“Is we?”</p>

<p>“We are! We’re going to stay right here,
June. If I don’t get on the baseball team I’ll
find a job somewhere. And you can do the
same.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but what’s to hinder me from gettin’
me a job right now?” asked June.</p>

<p>Wayne considered. Finally he shook his head.
“No,” he answered, “I don’t want you working
if I’m not. We’ve got enough to last us five
weeks; four, anyway; and when we get toward the
end of the money we can begin to look for something
to do. If Mr. Milburn gives me a try-out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
and I make good, why, you won’t have to work.”</p>

<p>“Say I won’? How come, Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p>“You’ll keep house for me, June, and look after
Sam. And you can go to school again. We’ll
find a couple of rooms where we can get our own
meals. How would you like that?”</p>

<p>“With a real cook stove, Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a real, sure-enough one, June. And we’ll
buy a whole outfit of pans and dishes and everything.
And there’ll be a pantry with all sorts of
things in it: canned soup and flour and sugar
and——”</p>

<p>“Molasses?” asked June eagerly.</p>

<p>“Of course. Everything we want.”</p>

<p>“Lawsy-y-y!” crooned June, hugging himself
tightly and rolling his eyes. “Jus’ like quality,
Mas’ Wayne! Say, I goin’ to cook a big mess of
pork an’ cabbage the very firs’ thing! I ain’ had
none of that for a mighty long ol’ time, I’m tellin’
you.”</p>

<p>“That’s ‘if’,” reminded Wayne. “Maybe it
won’t happen, though.”</p>

<p>“Mas’ Wayne,” said June earnestly, “it’s jus’
got to happen, yes, sir! If that yere Mister
Manager don’ give you that yere job I goin’
pesker the life out’n him! ’Deed I is, yes, sir!
I’m goin’ make him pow’ful mis’able.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to do a little ‘peskering’ myself,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
responded Wayne grimly. “And I’m going to
begin tomorrow morning. Now, though, I’m going
to sleep.”</p>

<p>In the morning they found a little restaurant
within a block of their new lodgings and had
breakfast there. It wasn’t a very attractive
place, and the tablecloths were likely to be soiled,
but the food was satisfactory and the prices well
within the limit Wayne had decided on. Also, the
proprietor, a little man with a pronounced squint
who talked in broken English, took a liking to Sam
and neither of the boys had to stint his appetite
to provide for the dog. After that first morning
Sam trotted at once to the door at the back and
stood there with an inquiring gaze and slowly
wagging tail until the expected chop bone or other
delicacy came his way.</p>

<p>After breakfast June and Sam were left to their
own devices and Wayne set forth for the ball park.
Summer had come to Harrisville in its full intensity
now and that long walk through the city
and out beyond where there were neither buildings
nor trees to mitigate the ferocity of the sun
left the boy rather limp. As on the first occasion,
Mike held him up at the door, but, recognising
him the next instant, passed him through unsuspectingly.
Today practice was in full swing
when he entered the enclosure. Mr. Milburn was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
batting grounders to the infield and the portly
trainer was knocking up flies. No one paid any
attention to Wayne, and he crossed to the bench
in the shade of the right base stand and settled
himself to watch. Perhaps yesterday’s victory
had restored the manager’s good-humour, for he
was quite a different despot this morning. He
didn’t hesitate to criticise or find fault, but his
criticisms were just, and his fault-finding excusable.
And he was quite as quick to praise as
blame today. The players seemed in a merry
mood and jokes and sallies passed from one to
another across the diamond. Wayne’s first acquaintance,
“Red” Herring, was limbering up
his long arm, in company with the rest of the
pitchers, at the other side of the field; Linton and
Young catching. In deep right field, two painters,
seated on a swinging scaffold, were dividing their
attention between the sign they were at work on
and the practice.</p>

<p>Both Mr. Milburn and Mr. Slattery, the trainer,
caught the balls as they were returned to them
from the fielders, and now and then one got away
from them. Presently a ball thrown to the trainer
went wide and rolled nearly to the fence at the
entrance. Being nearer than Mr. Slattery, Wayne
went after it and tossed it back. The trainer accepted
it without comment, swung his bat and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
sent it flying out into the field again. When it
came in again, however, it passed well out of the
trainer’s reach and that individual, turning with
an exclamation of disgust, saw it, to his surprise,
bound into the hands of Wayne. Unseen of the
trainer, Wayne had signalled to the fielder with
upraised hand. Mr. Slattery grunted, accepted
the ball and sent it sailing forth again. After
that it was Wayne who caught the throw-in each
time, taking it on the bound, and who tossed it
lightly to the batter. The latter accepted the
service silently, doubtless glad to have it performed
for him and not troubling about the performer’s
identity. But, looking across to the plate
once, Wayne found Manager Milburn observing
him curiously, perhaps wondering where he had
seen him before. That the manager did not remember
him seemed evident a few minutes later
when the players were called in and someone reported
that the second base bag had broken away.
Mr. Milburn called to the trainer.</p>

<p>“Jimmy, send in and get a new strap for the
second base bag,” he directed. “Jones says it’s
broken.” And when Jimmy Slattery turned to
waddle back to the dressing-room he added:
“Send your helper, Jimmy, and you take them
over to the nets.”</p>

<p>“This feller?” asked Jimmy viewing Wayne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
doubtfully. “You know where they are?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>“I’ll find them, sir,” said Wayne.</p>

<p>“Well, get one, then, like a good feller,” said
Jimmy, “and slip it on the second bag.”</p>

<p>Wayne entered the shed and looked around.
There was a table in the first half-lighted room,
and a half-dozen ticket boxes in a row on the
floor. The table held a telephone instrument,
some newspapers, a blotting-pad that looked as
though it had been unchanged for many years and
a litter of miscellaneous articles. But there were
no base straps there and Wayne penetrated to the
next apartment. This was evidently the dressing-room,
for one side was lined with wooden lockers,
most of them open and displaying the street costumes
of the players, and on the other side were
half a dozen showers. Two bare tables occupied
the centre. Three wooden benches about completed
the furnishings. One of the benches held
a pile of towels and a box which, containing bottles
and rolls of tape and gauze, exhaled a strong
odour of liniment. But still there were no straps
and Wayne returned to the outer room and was
about to acknowledge defeat when his eyes fell
on a closet. Although its door was closed, the
key was in the lock, and when he had pulled it open
he found what he was after. There were all sorts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of things in that closet: base bags, bats, boxes
of balls, masks, chest protectors, boxes whose contents
he could only guess at, and, finally, a lot of
straps depending from a nail. Wayne took one
of the latter, closed the door as he had found it
and went out again.</p>

<p>Everyone had crossed to the further side of
the field where the batting-nets stood, and Wayne
took the strap down to second base and proceeded
to fix it in place. When he had finished
and had secured the bag to its spike he went
over to Jimmy Slattery, who was coaching the
batters at the nearer net, and held out the
broken strap. “What shall I do with this?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Huh?” asked Jimmy. “Oh, throw it away,
kid. Want a job?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Wayne truthfully.</p>

<p>“Get out there then and chase some of those
balls,” directed the other.</p>

<p>So Wayne went down the field, discarded his
jacket and placed it against the fence and got
to work. It was work, too, for only three of the
players were fielding and they were quite content
to let Wayne run after the hits that went over
their heads or got past them. Now and then
Wayne had the fun of trying for a fly. When he
did he usually got it, although he started out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
with a muff that brought ironical remarks from
the others.</p>

<p>“Open your mouth and let it fall in,” called
Fawcett.</p>

<p>“Put your hands up,” advised Briggs facetiously,
“and see will the ball hit ’em, kid!”</p>

<p>But Wayne only smiled as he trotted after the
elusive sphere and threw it to the nearer fielder.
The next time the ball did hit his hands and,
moreover, stayed in them, and Briggs was ready
with a cheerful “’Ata boy! Squeeze it!” After
that, by common consent, a fly that passed over
the heads of the three players was left to Wayne
undisputed.</p>

<p>“Say, Win,” called Briggs once, “you’ll be
losing your job first thing you know. The kid’s
clever!”</p>

<p>At first Wayne threw to Briggs or Fawcett or
the third fielder, Leary, and let them peg the
ball back to the pitcher, but presently, when he
had stopped a grounder well in, he took courage
and threw the ball in himself and threw it so well
that Fawcett turned and regarded him with new
interest.</p>

<p>“Can you do that every time, stranger?” inquired
the substitute outfielder. “’Cause, if
you can, you’d better strike the boss for a
job!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>After a while Fawcett, Briggs, and Leary went
in to take their turns at the net and a new trio
came out to field. One was “Sailor” O’Neill, the
left fielder, and “Sailor,” sauntering out toward
Wayne, observed him curiously.</p>

<p>“Where’d you come from, kid?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Medfield,” replied Wayne.</p>

<p>“Steve signed you on, has he?”</p>

<p>“Not yet.”</p>

<p>“Is he going to? Are you the fellow ‘Red’ was
telling me about?”</p>

<p>“I reckon so,” was the answer. “Mr. Farrel
sent me here for a try-out, but Mr. Milburn says
he don’t need me.”</p>

<p>“Huh! One of Chris’ finds, eh? Well, he
picks a good ’un now and then; about once in
three years. Keep after him, kid. He’ll come
across all right.”</p>

<p>Further conversation was interrupted by a
sizzling grounder that reminded “Sailor” of his
duties.</p>

<p>The morning’s work-out ended with practice
on the bases and Wayne went back to the bench.
He didn’t have it to himself now, for Jimmy
Slattery, very warm and puffing from his recent
exertions, was there, as were four of the pitching
staff, “Hop” Nye amongst them. “Hop” recognised
Wayne and nodded. The others viewed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
with mild curiosity. Only Jimmy challenged his
presence there.</p>

<p>“How do you happen to be in here, kid?” he
asked when Wayne had seated himself on the
bench.</p>

<p>“I’m waiting for a try-out,” answered the boy
as casually as he could. “Mr. Farrel sent me.”</p>

<p>“Oh.” But the trainer was still evidently puzzled.
After a minute, spent in surreptitious examination
of the boy, he inquired with a trace of
sarcasm: “And what might you be? A pitcher
or a catcher or what?”</p>

<p>“Infielder, sir. Second baseman, for choice.”</p>

<p>“Huh! You’ve got a choice, have you? That’s
fine! What’s the boss say?”</p>

<p>“He hasn’t decided yet.”</p>

<p>Nye, who had overheard the conversation,
leaned forward and spoke to the trainer. “He’s
all right, Jimmy,” said “Hop.” “Chris sent him
up and Steve won’t give him a look-over. <em>Says</em>
he won’t, anyway. What’s your name, kid?”</p>

<p>“Sloan, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, Sloan, you take my advice and keep
right after him. You’ll have to if you want to
get anything out of him. Ain’t that so, Jimmy?”</p>

<p>“It’s true as true, my boy. I don’t see, though,
what for Chris Farrel sent us an infielder. Can
you hit the ball any?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—yes, sir, a little.”</p>

<p>“A little won’t get you anything, my boy.
What the boss is lookin’ for is fellers as can swing
on ’em hard. Still and all, I ain’t saying you
mightn’t develop if Steve’ll take you on. Who
was you playing with last?”</p>

<p>“Medfield,” answered Wayne.</p>

<p>“Medfield? I never heard of them,” pondered
the trainer.</p>

<p>“It’s an amateur team, sir.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s it, eh? You’re one o’ them
gentlemen amachoors, are you? Well, Joe,
here, was one o’ them things himself till I found
him. ’Twas me that rescued him from a life of
crime.”</p>

<p>Joe Casey turned a tanned countenance and
grinned along the bench. “When you found me,
Jimmy,” he said, “I was playin’ with a bunch
that knew baseball, take it from me. That team
could give us two runs an inning and beat us without
trying.”</p>

<p>“Yah!” said Jimmy disdainfully. “Listen to
him, fellers! When I first set my eyes on that
guy he was playing toss with a bunch of these
here Willie Boys, and all dolled up in fancy togs
like a moving-picture hero! Wore a silk shirt,
he did! And every time he steps gracefully to
the box a lot of his sissy friends waves little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
pink flags and cheers right out loud for him!
Say, believe me, fellers, it was killing!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” responded Casey, with a
laugh. “That same bunch of Willie Boys could
play ball some! We were the champs three years
running, old scout!”</p>

<p>“I know, but them girls’ schools is easy to
beat,” replied Jimmy, with a wink at Wayne.
The others on the bench laughed and Jimmy
pulled himself to his feet. “Kid,” he said, “if
you want a try-out you’ve got to make the boss
think you’re good. Tell him you fielded for a
thousand and batted for seven hundred. He
won’t believe you, but he might be curious to see
how you stack up. And keep after him, laddie.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” answered Wayne. “I mean to.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>JUNE GOES TO WORK</small></h2>
</div>


<p>But Wayne did not approach Manager Milburn
that day. Somehow the occasion failed to present
itself, and, while determined to overcome the
other’s resistance by perseverance, he did not
want to start out by making a nuisance of himself.
Save that he became slightly acquainted with
several other members of the Harrisville Club
that morning, he could not be said to have made
much progress. He wanted very much to see that
final game with Doncaster in the afternoon, but
it meant the price of two dinners approximately,
since it didn’t even occur to him to go without
June. He had to be satisfied with reading about
it in the late edition of the evening paper and
was vastly disappointed when he learned that the
Billies had fallen on Joe Casey in the eighth and
driven him to cover, scoring four hits and two
runs and securing a lead that the home team had
been unable to overcome. Herring had finished
in the box for Harrisville and had held the opponent
safe, but the damage had been done by that
time and the final score read 7 to 6. Doncaster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
had, consequently, split even on the series and
incidentally reduced Harrisville’s lead in the
league standing to eight games. Damascus had
won again that day from Utica and slipped into
second place. Wayne concluded that it would be
well to wait until Harrisville had won her next
game before presenting himself again to Mr.
Milburn.</p>

<p>A single line under the caption “With the
Amateur Clubs” announced: “At Medfield;
Chenango, 14, Atlas A. A., 2.” Something rather
like a pang of homesickness went through him
then and he almost wished himself back in Medfield.
He wrote a letter to Arthur Pattern that
night before going to bed and sent his new
address.</p>

<p>Sunday was a quiet and rather dull day for the
boys. They went for a walk in the afternoon and
explored the city pretty well, but the only incident
of interest occurred when Sam made the mistake
of underrating the fighting ability of a large
gray cat and returned sadder and wiser after an
encounter in an alley. Tabby had clawed his nose
most thoroughly and Sam had to whimper a little
and be sympathised with before the journey continued.
By getting up late that morning and
dressing very leisurely they managed to make
breakfast and dinner suffice in the way of meals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
thus saving twenty cents. (The saving would
have been thirty cents had not June fallen victim
to the fascination of a chocolate éclair and Wayne
squandered another nickel on a Sunday paper.)</p>

<p>On Monday Wayne went back to the ball park
and again served as utility man, catching throw-ins
for Jimmy Slattery and backing up the fielders
during batting practice. He was rapidly becoming
an accepted feature of the morning work and
the players, most of whom had by this time heard
his story, were very friendly toward him, “Red”
Herring especially. Practice lacked vim this
morning, and the manager, while he gave no such
exhibition of temper as he had displayed Friday,
was plainly disgruntled. Wayne took pains to
keep out of his way, but he was haunted by a feeling
that Mr. Milburn’s lack of recognition was
only assumed. Once Wayne surprised the
manager observing him with an expression that,
while not unfriendly, was decidedly ironical. He
wondered then whether Mr. Milburn had recognised
him Saturday. Somehow he rather thought
he had!</p>

<p>Practice again ended without any apparent advancement
of Wayne’s fortunes, for he had by
now determined that when he again broached the
subject of that try-out to the manager it should
be after Harrisville had won a game and while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Mr. Milburn was in the best of humours. To
bring the matter up at the wrong moment might,
he suspected, result disastrously. Although
Wayne was unacquainted with the phrase, it was
the psychological moment that he waited for.
Besides, there was another thing that he was
banking on, and that was the return to Harrisville
of Chris Farrel. It seemed to him that
Chris could easily secure that try-out if only he
would put in his appearance. But inquiry that
morning of Jimmy Slattery was not encouraging.
Jimmy didn’t know when Chris would get back.
He had heard that the scout was working his way
south as far as Maryland. He might be back
tomorrow or next week. He came and went about
as he saw fit, a fact which Jimmy, for some reason
not apparent to Wayne, seemed to resent.</p>

<p>Damascus had no trouble winning that Monday
game. Herring started in the box for the Badgers
but lasted only three innings and was succeeded
by Tommy Cotton. In the seventh Cotton resigned
and Nick Crane took up the task. Harrisville
played rather poorly, Wayne learned from
the evening paper. At all events, Damascus
gathered in the contest to the tune of 4 to 0.</p>

<p>Tuesday’s work-out went with a new dash and
vigour, and the batting practice lasted twice as
long as usual. It was freely given out that Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Milburn intended to win a majority of those four
games, which meant that the Badgers must take
the remaining three. That afternoon “Red”
Herring again started the performance and this
time he went through without a hitch, and, although
the home club failed again to win renown
with their sticks, the game went to the Badgers
2 to 1. Wayne was tempted to try his fortunes
with Mr. Milburn that evening, but discretion held
him back. If the Badgers took tomorrow’s game
perhaps he would risk it. Or maybe it would be
still safer to wait until the Badgers had secured
their three out of four. That is, if they did.
They had got back their eight-game lead again,
but Doncaster had won both games of a double
header with Trenton and was now tied for second
place, and it was no secret that Manager Milburn
feared the Billies more than the Damascus club.</p>

<p>Wayne got a reply from Jim Mason that afternoon.
Jim was all for having Wayne give up and
come back to his job. Perhaps he had read more
in the boy’s letter than Wayne had intended him
to. “I haven’t got any new fellow in your place
yet,” wrote Jim, “and I won’t if you say you’re
coming back. I can get along for another week
I guess but you better write and say you are
coming back so I will know whether to expect you
or not. The missis is well and so is Terry. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
sends you his love and says please come back to
see him. We are not very busy right now but
last week they dumped a string of foreigns on me
and I had a tough time getting shut of them.
Terry says tell you the chicken with the twisted
leg up and died on him the other day. So no
more at present.”</p>

<p>Wayne was strongly tempted after reading
Jim’s letter to see Mr. Milburn then and there
and, if he still refused, to go back to Medfield
on the first train in the morning. Perhaps it was
a chance remark of June’s, as much as anything
else, that kept him from yielding to that temptation.</p>

<p>“I sure does like this yere Ha’isville,” declared
June that evening at supper. “Wouldn’ go back
to that little ol’ Medfield if they ask me, no, sir!”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t?” asked Wayne. “Why,
June?”</p>

<p>“’Cause this is a regular white man’s town,
Mas’ Wayne. Livin’s cheap an’ fine, an’ folkses
is fine, an’ there’s somethin’ goin’ on all the time.
An’ if I wanted to, Mas’ Wayne, I could get me
a job in no time at all, I could so, yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a job, June?”</p>

<p>June waved a fork vaguely but grandly. “Anythin’
at all,” he answered. “I met up with a
nigger blacks boots at that yere Congress House<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
you-all was tellin’ about an’ he say he can get me
a job there tomorrow if I wants it, yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“As bell boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, an’ it don’ cost me but four bits.”</p>

<p>“Who gets the four bits, June?”</p>

<p>“This yere nigger I’m tellin’ you about. That’s
his commission.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he wants a half-dollar for getting you the
job, you mean?” Wayne was silent a moment.
Then: “June, that’s where Mr. Milburn lives,” he
said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Yes, I ’member you tellin’ me that.”</p>

<p>“I wonder——” Wayne’s voice dwindled off
again to silence. At last: “Would you like to
take that job, June?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not if you-all don’ want me to, Mas’ Wayne.
I ain’ complainin’ none. ’Course, ain’ much to
do ’cept hang aroun’——”</p>

<p>“You go there tomorrow and grab it,” said
Wayne.</p>

<p>“Hones’? You ain’ mindin’ if I do?”</p>

<p>“No, I’d rather you did, June. You might—I
don’t see how you could, exactly—but you
might——”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p>“Well, you just <em>might</em> be able to help me,
June, if you were at the Congress House. Suppose,
for instance, I wanted to see Mr. Milburn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
and the clerk wouldn’t let me up. If you sort of
made his acquaintance and got friendly with
him——”</p>

<p>“Lawsy-y-y! Ain’ that the truth? Mas’
Wayne, I goin’ make that yere Mister Manager
jus’ love me, yes, sir! I goin’ be so nice an’ ’tentive
to him——”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” laughed Wayne. “Make him love
you so much that he will give me a place on the
team, June.”</p>

<p>“That’s jus’ what I’m aimin’ to do,” replied
June, showing all his teeth in a broad grin. “You
jus’ wait till I gets me acquainted with that Mister
Man. I—I goin’ put a conjur on him, yes, sir!”</p>

<p>The next morning June departed, armed with
his “four bits” and his ingratiating smile in the
direction of the Congress House and Wayne saw
him no more until supper time. Wayne spent
the forenoon at the ball grounds making himself
useful. Today his duties included catching
“Red” again. Linton did not show up and as
Young couldn’t attend to more than three of the
pitchers Herring found a mitt for Wayne and
towed him across to the third base side of the
field and ranged him alongside Catcher Young.</p>

<p>“You take the other fellers, Dan,” said “Red.”
“I got me a catcher.”</p>

<p>Wayne was a little embarrassed and awkward at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
first, but by the time “Red” was getting warmed
up and putting speed into the ball he was so
interested that he forgot all self-consciousness.
“Red” was feeling in fine form this morning, possibly
as a result of yesterday’s game, and some of
his deliveries were hard to judge. There was a
“jump ball” in particular that always caused
Wayne anxiety until it had settled into his mitten.
Crane, Nye, and Cotton, who were pitching to
Young, and Young, too, for that matter, observed
the emergency catcher with interest. It was
“Hop” who asked presently: “You and Steve got
together yet, kid?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” replied Wayne cheerfully, rolling
the ball from mitt to hand and tossing it back to
Herring. “There’s no hurry, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Better not leave it too long,” advised Cotton.
“Chris Farrel’ll be sending another rookie along
first thing anyone knows. He’s a great one for
that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Chris is all right,” said Herring. “He discovered
Cob Morgan and Bee Bennett, didn’t he?
And I sort of guess they ain’t so poor.”</p>

<p>“Chris makes about one lucky guess in ten,”
observed Pitcher Crane, “but maybe that’s a good
average. I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“You twirling this afternoon, Nick?” asked
Herring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“I guess so. The boss is crazy to cop the next
two games.”</p>

<p>“Don’t look like it,” said Cotton innocently.
“You’d think he’d put a good pitcher in today.”</p>

<p>Crane only smiled. Nick, in the words of the
Harrisville baseball scribes, was the “dean of
the pitching corps,” and didn’t have to answer
such aspersions. Just then Manager Milburn
summoned Herring to take Casey’s place on the
mound and Wayne was for removing his mitt.
Young, however, suggested his taking Nye off
his hands and Wayne assented. “Hop” was easy
after Herring, for he used straight balls a good
deal and although they came like lightning they
were far easier to judge than “Red’s” eccentric
slants. Later, when the players moved to the
nets, Wayne encountered another of Manager
Milburn’s sarcastic glances, but he didn’t mind.
As long as the manager didn’t object to his being
on the field during practice Wayne was for the
present satisfied.</p>

<p>That afternoon he received a letter, forwarded
from Medfield, that brought his heart into his
mouth as he read the postmark and recognized
the writing. It was from his stepfather, and for
a moment Wayne hesitated to open it, fearing that
it was a summons home. But it wasn’t. Mr.
Higgins was brief and decided. “Understand,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
he wrote, “that this is your doing and not mine.
Don’t come home here expecting me to take you
in again for I won’t. And don’t apply to me for
money. You won’t get any. You will have to
get along by your own efforts. I hope you will
do so, but nothing I have ever seen of you leads
me to expect it.”</p>

<p>“It sounds a heap like him,” murmured Wayne,
thrusting the letter back into its envelope. “He
never did think I was any good, anyway. But
I’ll show him. And he needn’t be afraid of my
going back or asking him for money, because I
wouldn’t, not if I was starving to death!” Wayne
clenched his hands tightly and frowned at the
letter. Then the frown faded and gave place to
a satisfied smile. “Anyway,” he said to himself,
“he isn’t going to try to get me back, and that’s
a load off a fellow’s mind!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>MR. MILBURN PROMISES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>June took a shining half-dollar from his pocket
and slipped it along the counter. Wayne examined
it questioningly.</p>

<p>“Mister Milburn done give me that,” chuckled
June. “An’ all I done was jus’ fetch him some
seegars from the news-stand.”</p>

<p>“You mean he tipped you a whole half-dollar
for that?” marvelled Wayne.</p>

<p>June nodded. “Yes, sir, that’s all I done. He
say, ‘Boy, fetch me two seegars from the news-stand.
Tell them they’s for Mister Milburn an’
they’ll know what you want.’ An’ he give me a
dollar bill an’ they was seventy-five cents change
an’ he say, ‘Where you come from? I ain’ seen
you before, has I?’ An’ I say, ‘No, sir, you ain’.
I’m the new bell boy, sir, an’ anytime you wants
anythin’ done partic’lar jus’ you asks for June.’
He sorter laughed an’ say as how he’s goin’
remember, an’ asks me where did I come from,
an’ I tell him I come from Colquitt County,
Georgia, an’ he say he knows Colquitt County
’cause he was to a trainin’ camp down thataway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
once.” June paused long enough to transfer some
of the contents of his plate to his mouth, and then,
heedful of his companion’s mandate regarding
conversation and a full mouth, waited another
moment before continuing. “We got on fine, him
an’ me, Mas’ Wayne. He’s a right sociable gen’leman,
yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Wayne laughed. “I reckon that half-dollar was
for your conversation, June, and not for the errand.
Did you tell him you came here from
Medfield?”</p>

<p>June shook his head innocently. “He ain’ ask
me that.”</p>

<p>“Well, you made a good start. Do you like the
work, June?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, it’s a right promisin’ place. Lot’s
o’ free-spendin’ gen’lemen at that yere hotel.
Reckon I’m goin’ do better’n I did at the Union.
I gets four dollars a week. They works you
longer, though, ’cause I got to get there at six in
the mornin’ an’ I don’ get through till six in the
evenin’.”</p>

<p>“Why, that’s twelve hours, June!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but the more I’m aroun’ there the
more I’m goin’ to put in my jeans. I made a
dollar an’ ten cents today, Mas’ Wayne; an’ I’d
a done better’n that if them other boys hadn’
tried to friz me out. There’s four of them, an’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
one’s a big yaller boy with a mean disposition.
I reckon,” June added thoughtfully, “I’ll jus’
have to lam him good before he quits foolin’ with
me!”</p>

<p>“You’d better not,” cautioned Wayne. “This
isn’t Medfield, and they might fire you if they
found you fighting.”</p>

<p>“They ain’ goin’ to fin’ me. I’m goin’ do
it where they won’ know nothin’ about it. How
come them other gen’lemen pesker us like they
done today, Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p>“What other gentlemen? Oh, you mean the
Damascus club. We just couldn’t hit them any
more than they could hit us, June. You see Mr.
Milburn pitched Nick Crane and so the Damascus
manager put in Woodworth, their best man, and
it was a pitchers’ battle right through the whole
eleven innings. If Bennett hadn’t stolen home
from third with two out in the eleventh I reckon
they’d be playing yet. I’d like to have seen that
steal. It must have been a dandy!”</p>

<p>“Sure must! That gives us three games to
their two, don’ it? Reckon we’ll win the one
tomorrow, Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I heard that they’re going to
use a fellow named Ripley, and they say he’s almost
as good as Woodworth. He’s a spit-ball
pitcher.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am’ never see nobody pitch one of them
yere spit-balls,” said June. “Who goin’ pitch
for us, sir?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it will be Nye. It’s his turn, I think.
Either Nye or Cotton. I reckon if Damascus
plays the way she played today tomorrow’s game
is going to be worth seeing.”</p>

<p>“Why don’ you-all go an’ see it, Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p>“Can’t afford it, June. We’ve been here a
week now and——”</p>

<p>“You ain’ got to ’ford it,” chuckled June.
“Mister Milburn say if I want to see a game jus’
let him know an’ he goin’ pass me in. I’ll ask
him about it tomorrow an’ you can take the
ticket.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t want you to give it to anyone
else, June. Maybe I’ll try walking in past Mike
at the players’ gate. I don’t believe he would
stop me, and I don’t believe anyone would mind,
because I’ve helped a good deal out there in the
mornings, June.”</p>

<p>“Sure you has, Mas’ Wayne! You got a perfec’ly
good right to see them games, yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Wayne exhibited his stepfather’s letter then
and June, after he had slowly puzzled through it,
snorted with disgust. “Ain’ that like him, Mas’
Wayne, sir? Ain’ it jus’ <em>like</em> him? Firs’ thing
he thinks of is money! I can’ ever say jus’ what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
I thinks of that gen’leman ’cause he’s a sort o’
relation o’ yours, Mas’ Wayne, but I certainly
does do a heap o’ thinkin’!”</p>

<p>“Anyway, he intends to let me alone, June, and
that’s what I wanted. As for money, why, he
will have to give me some when I’m twenty-one
because mother left me almost twelve hundred
dollars and he only has it in trust.”</p>

<p>“Reckon he ain’ wishin’ for you-all to remember
that,” replied June, shaking his head. “An’
if I was you, Mas’ Wayne, I’d write to Lawyer
Ackerman an’ tell him to keep a mighty sharp
watch on that yere stepdaddy of yours, yes, sir!”</p>

<p>“He can’t very well run off with the farm,
June,” laughed Wayne, “and as long as
that’s there I reckon I can always get my
money.”</p>

<p>June was passing along the second floor corridor
of the Congress House the next morning,
laden with a number of empty ice-water pitchers
and crooning a song, when a door opened and
Mr. Milburn confronted him.</p>

<p>“Boy! Run down and get me a Philadelphia
paper. Any one will do. Oh, is that you,
January?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, Mister Milburn, I ain’ January yet,
sir; I’m jus’ June.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right, June,” chuckled the manager.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
“Hustle up that paper. I’ve got a dime here
that’s looking for a home.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, don’ you do nothin’ with it till I
returns,” answered June, sprinting for the stairs.</p>

<p>When he came back and knocked on the door
and was told to enter Mr. Milburn was seated at
a table clipping things from various newspapers
and pasting them in a huge scrapbook. “That’s
the boy,” he said, “and here’s your dime, June.
How did they come to call you June, eh?”</p>

<p>“’Tain’ really June, sir, it’s Junius; Junius
Brutus Bartow Tasker is my full name, Mister
Milburn.”</p>

<p>“‘Full’ is good! Going out to see my boys
play today, Junius Brutus And-so-forth?”</p>

<p>“I can’ get off today, sir, but I got a friend that
would like powerful much to see that game.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not proposing to supply your friends
with tickets, boy. Hasn’t this friend got a
quarter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but he’s needin’ all the quarters he’s
got, jus’ like me, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right.” Mr. Milburn produced a slip
of paper and scrawled a hurried signature on it.
“There you are. Tell him to show that to the
man at the ticket office and he will fix him out.
Haven’t you seen my club play yet?”</p>

<p>“Once, Mister Milburn. We seen ’em lick those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Billies last—last Friday, I reckon it was. An’
we seen some ball playin’! Yes, sir, we surely
did so!”</p>

<p>“Who are ‘we’? You and this friend of
yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He ain’ exac’ly a friend, though.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t he?” Mr. Milburn turned the pages of
the paper June had brought him and hurriedly
scanned them. “Isn’t an enemy, is he?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, he’s—he’s my boss.”</p>

<p>“Your boss? What do you mean by that?”
The manager dropped the paper to the floor,
glanced at his watch and turned an amused gaze
on the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, he’s Mas’ Wayne Sloan, sir, an’ the
Sloans is quality down in Colquitt County. You
see, Mas’ Wayne’s mother she up an’ die ’bout
three-four years ago an’ this yere stepdaddy of
his ain’ no earthly ’count, no, sir, he ain’. He
jus’ pesker Mas’ Wayne somethin’ fierce till him
an’ me we jus’ lit out an’ come up North here.”</p>

<p>“Sloan?” inquired Mr. Milburn. “He’s a white
boy, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Sloan, eh? Look here, that isn’t the kid that
Farrel sent to me for a try-out, is it? A dark-haired
chap with——”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, that’s Mas’ Wayne. How come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
you-all ain’ given him that yere try-out yet,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s an infielder, June, and we don’t
need infielders. I told him that days ago, but
he’s still hanging around, I see.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, we’re waitin’.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m afraid waiting won’t do him any
good, June. You’d better tell him so. I like the
kid’s perseverance, but he’s wasting his time.
If he was a couple of years older and could play
a little I’d give him a chance.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, an’ I reckon he’s goin’ be a couple
years older if you-all don’ hurry up!” June’s grin
robbed the statement of offence. “Mister Milburn,
please, sir, can I tell you somethin’?”</p>

<p>“Go ahead, June.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, Mas’ Wayne’s surely one fine ball
player,” said June earnestly, “an’ you-all ain’
actin’ sensible if you don’ grab him, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s just your idea of him, June,” was
the good-natured reply. “We get dozens like him
every spring, fellows fresh from high school or
college who think that if they can hold a ball
when it’s thrown to them they’re regular Big
Leaguers.”</p>

<p>“How come this yere Mr. Farrel done send him
over here, sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Farrel plays it safe, June. He has instructions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
to pick up anything that looks good and
ship him over for me to see. But he isn’t
supposed to rob the nurseries. We can’t use
them until they’re grown up.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, seems like this yere Mister Farrel
ain’ actin’ jus’ right. He done tell Mas’ Wayne
how you goin’ give him a try-out an’ all, an’ Mas’
Wayne he give up his position in Medfield an’
now ain’ nothin’ ’tall come of it. It don’ seem
jus’ right, sir, does it? Mas’ Wayne he ’lows
we’s goin’ stay right here till he gets that yere
try-out, yes, sir, but we ain’ got but about fifty
dollars an’ that ain’ goin’ to last forever, is it?
Please, sir, Mister Milburn, I wish you’d jus’ give
him that ol’ try-out, sir, an’ then, if he don’ act
good, we knows where we’re at! Couldn’ you
jus’ do that, please, sir?”</p>

<p>The manager frowned impatiently, slapped the
scrapbook shut, opened it again, and once more
looked at his watch. June observed him anxiously
but continued to smile. Perhaps it was that smile
that decided the question, for Mr. Milburn saw it
and the corners of his own mouth began to go up,
and presently he laughed.</p>

<p>“All right, June,” he said. “He shall have his
try-out. Maybe tomorrow. By the first of the
week, anyway. You can tell him so. And you
can tell him he owes it to you. Mostly, at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
rate.” The manager arose. “Maybe I’d have
given it to him anyhow sooner or later, just to
get rid of him!” he added grumblingly. He
turned with pretended ferocity on June. “You
got that dime, didn’t you?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, thanky, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you waiting for then? Beat
it! Get out of here before you think up any
more hard-luck stories! Here, give me that
pass!”</p>

<p>June yielded it and the manager tore it in half
and dropped the pieces on the floor. “Tell Sloan
I said he was to go in the players’ gate. I guess
he’s earned the right to see one game. Now get
out of here, you black nuisance!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied June, grinning from ear to
ear. “Thanky, sir. Hope you wins your game,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Hope you get your wish, June! You don’t
happen to own a rabbit’s foot, do you? One of
the lucky sort, I mean.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I ain’ got no rabbit’s foot, but you-all’s
goin’ win today, Mister Milburn, yes, sir! I goin’
put a conjur on that yere game!”</p>

<p>“You and your conjurs!” laughed the other.
“We’ll see, though, and if we don’t win—well,
you’d better keep out of my reach, boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” chuckled June from the doorway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
“if we don’ win I’m goin’ give you the whole
sidewalk!”</p>

<p>June, however, had no chance to give Mr. Milburn’s
message to Wayne, for Wayne did not
come around to the hotel and June’s duties prevented
him from seeking him at noon hour. June
got his dinners at the hotel, which meant a saving
of thirty cents a day, but he wasn’t allowed much
time to eat them in. Consequently it was with the
intention of walking boldly past Mike, the gate-man,
that Wayne started out for the field that
afternoon. Yesterday’s close contest, and the fact
that today’s encounter was the last with the
Damascus club at Harrisville until after the home
team’s swing around the circle which began next
week, had combined to awaken a more than usual
amount of interest in the afternoon’s game and
the cars that buzzed and clanged their way past
Wayne were filled to the running-boards. It was
evident that the attendance at the park today
would assume holiday proportions, and, too, that
the railway company had, in spite of extra cars,
failed to accommodate all who wanted to ride.
Wayne had started early, hoping to get there
about the time the players went in and trusting to
the good offices of “Red” Herring or some other
acquaintance to gain him admittance should Mike
prove obdurate, but the players had passed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
long ago in their car and it lacked but twenty
minutes of starting time when he got within distant
sight of the park.</p>

<p>It was then that he noticed that the trolley cars
were blocked somewhere ahead. The passengers
were jumping off and starting the rest of the
journey afoot, but Wayne thought nothing of it
until the imperative clang of an ambulance bell
sounded on his ears and he turned to watch the
vehicle dash hurriedly past, scattering pedestrians
to right and left. Before Wayne had covered the
next two squares, the ambulance passed again,
speeding now in the direction of town, with a
white-garbed doctor swaying on the steps.</p>

<p>“Reckon someone got smashed up,” reflected
Wayne, walking a little faster. The folks about
him were audibly conjecturing on the accident but
no one seemed to know anything about it, and it
was not until Wayne had reached the corner of an
intersecting street a square from the ball grounds
that he learned the facts. The brakes on one of the
cars had failed to work and, since there was a
down-grade just here, it had crashed into the rear
of a car ahead. The two cars were there for
evidence, both badly crushed as to vestibules.
A motorman and two passengers had been badly
injured, Wayne heard, but no one had been killed.
Several others had been shaken up, but, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Wayne’s informant added, with a smile, they had
gone on into the ball game and so probably
weren’t dangerously injured! That reminded
Wayne of his own purpose and, after pushing his
way forward for a curious view of the damaged
cars, he hurried on again and sought the players’
gate. By now he had determined to see the game
in any event. After walking all the way from
town in the hot sun it would be silly to turn back,
he told himself, and he jingled the few coins in
his pocket reassuringly.</p>

<p>The door in the high fence was closed but
yielded readily to pressure and Wayne, looking as
nonchalant as he knew how, stepped inside. Mike
was standing a few yards away, talking with one
of the ground-keepers and didn’t turn until he
heard the creaking of the door as it went shut on
its rusty hinges. When he did turn, though,
Wayne saw an expression of lively interest on his
face and paused irresolutely, so certain was he
that Mike meant to deny him admittance. But
Mike’s greeting was startlingly different from
what Wayne expected. The door tender took a
step toward him and jerked an impatient thumb
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Hurry up an’ get in there,” he said. “The
boss is lookin’ for you!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>SECOND BASE SLOAN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The succeeding quarter-hour was always
strangely confused and indistinct in Wayne’s
memory. Damascus was warming up on the
diamond and Herring’s brilliant thatch showed
above the corner of the stand as the boy’s gaze
swept hurriedly toward the field ere he turned in
at the dressing-room door. Doubtless others of
the pitching staff were out there with “Red,” but
most of the players were still standing around the
office when Wayne entered. For the moment none
saw.</p>

<p>“This is what comes of keeping your salary
list down!” Manager Milburn was declaring
heatedly. “Lose two men and you’re shot to
pieces! How does he expect me to win games
with only enough players to cover the field? We
have a right to twenty-two and he gives me nineteen!
LaCroix, you take first. You’ll have to
play third, Jones, and Dan will play second. Hold
on! You catch Nye, don’t you? That won’t do
then. I’d better take second myself. Hustle out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
now, fellows. We’ve just got to do the best we
can and——”</p>

<p>“Here’s your man now, Steve!” exclaimed
someone, and Wayne, pausing doubtfully inside
the doorway, embarrassedly found himself the
target of all eyes. But it was for an instant only.
The next thing he knew Steve Milburn had him
by the arm and was dragging him forward.</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” he was demanding
irately. “I told that nigger boy of yours to send
you out! Jimmy, hustle a uniform! Someone
find me a contract form in the closet! Yellow box
on the shelf!” He turned to Wayne. “Now,
Sloan, you wanted a try-out and you’re going to
get it,” he said grimly. “Jimmy’ll give you a
uniform. Pile into it and—can you play third?
Where have you played?”</p>

<p>“Second, sir.”</p>

<p>“Take it then! That lets me out!”</p>

<p>“I can’t find any forms here, Boss,” sung out
Briggs from the closet.</p>

<p>“Never mind! This’ll do!” The manager
dropped into the chair by the littered table, opened
a drawer and pulled out a pad of paper and wrote
hurriedly for a moment. And as he wrote he
stabbed at Wayne with short sentences. “You got
your chance! Show what you know, youngster!
Make good and I’ll treat you white! Cap here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
will give you the dope. Do as he tells you. Now
sign your name here. Witness this, Cap.”</p>

<p>“Hurry up, kid, and climb into these,” called
Jimmy Slattery from the dressing-room doorway.</p>

<p>Wayne neither knew then nor later what he
signed. Had there been time to read the half-dozen
lines he could scarcely have done so, for Mr.
Milburn’s writing was not the sort to be deciphered
offhand. But he hardly tried. The
manager pushed a pen into his hand, Captain
Cross waited at his elbow and in thirty seconds he
was hurrying toward the armful of togs that the
trainer impatiently dangled at the door. Jimmy
helped him change, or tried to help, and all the
time dealt out advice freely, none of which Wayne
afterward recalled. Five minutes later he was
trotting out at the trainer’s heels, conscious of a
thumping heart and of the fact that the shoes on
his feet were at least a size too large for him.
Then he was around the corner of the stand and
Jimmy Slattery was pushing him in the general
direction of second base.</p>

<p>“Go ahead, kid, and good luck to you!” said
Jimmy. “Keep your nerve!”</p>

<p>But that was far easier said than done. The
stands were crowded and a fringe of enthusiasts
stood, three and four deep, inside the rope that
had been stretched along the left field side of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
enclosure. Balls were travelling back and forth,
from base to base and base to plate, bewilderingly,
while overhead the long flies arched to the
outfield. As he passed in front of LaCroix, at
first, the lantern-jawed, hook-nosed giant grinned
as he speared a high throw, and almost in the
same motion tossed it underhand to Wayne.</p>

<p>“Chuck it in, Bill,” he directed.</p>

<p>But if he thought to find Wayne asleep he was
disappointed, for the boy wheeled and caught the
descending ball and threw it to the plate. The
throw was short and Steve Milburn barked across
at him: “Keep ’em up, Sloan!” Captain Cross
met him and walked back with him to the trampled
ground behind the base line. “I’ll take the throws
from the plate, Sloan, but if I can’t get in for
them it’s up to you. Anything’s yours this side
of the bag, but don’t crowd LaCroix too much.
I’ll give you the signals on the runners. Just
keep steady and you’ll do all right, kid. Come on
now! Get into it!”</p>

<p>Five minutes of fielding followed, Manager Milburn
batting them out; hard liners that brought
Wayne up standing when they slammed into his
glove, slow rollers that sent him speeding nearly
to the pitcher’s box, pop-flies that lost themselves
for a moment in the glare of the sky, bounders that
brought all his baseball instinct into play. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the whole, he did none too well during that practice.
More than one ball went past him or dribbled
out of his hands. Once he muffed a fly
miserably. Twice he overthrew to first. After
the muffled fly he caught the dubious expression
on Captain Cross’ face and felt his heart sink.
Here, he thought, was the chance he had waited
and longed for, and now he was going to throw
it away! But in the next moment he was gritting
his teeth and thumping fist into glove determinedly.
He wouldn’t! He could play far
better than he had been playing! It was only the
crowd and the unnerving knowledge that so much
depended on this afternoon’s performance that
accounted for his fumbles. If only they had let
him practice just one morning, instead of thrusting
him like this into a game at a moment’s notice!
And then the bell sounded and they were trotting
in to the bench.</p>

<p>Manager Milburn beckoned to him and Wayne
crossed to where he was standing in front of the
little press box. Steve looked him over critically
while Wayne, red-faced, dripping perspiration,
waited. Finally: “How did it go?” asked the
manager.</p>

<p>Wayne smiled wanly. “Not very well, sir. I—I
reckon I’m sort of nervous.”</p>

<p>“Of course you are! You’ll forget that, though.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
Don’t take it too hard, Sloan, or you’ll pull a
boner, sure as shooting. Keep cool, that’s the
main thing. Use your head all the time. I’m
not expecting miracles, son,” he added kindly.
“Just do your best. That’s all I’m asking of you.
Can you hit?”</p>

<p>“I—yes, sir. I mean, I have hit some, but——”</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll soon see. Better try to wait
him out the first time. Watch his pitching and try
to make him give you what you can hit after that.
All right, fellows! On the run!”</p>

<p>Then the game started, Nye in the box for the
Badgers, Dan Young catching, LaCroix on first
in place of Morgan, Jones playing third for
Bennett, and an unknown at second. The umpire
had announced the latter’s name as Sloan, or something
like that, but no one had ever seen him before
or heard of him. He was a well-set-up
youngster and, in spite of the spills he had made
during practice, carried himself like a ball player.
The “fans” watched him and reserved judgment,
asking each other how Steve had managed to get
hold of him at less than a half-hour’s notice. For
it had been five minutes past three when the accident
had happened that had sent three of the
Badgers’ best players to the hospital, Bennett,
as was learned later, with a broken leg, Morgan
with three ribs caved in, and Pitcher Cotton with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
enough contusions to keep him out of the game for
a week at least. Morgan, said that evening’s
paper, would be back at work in a fortnight possibly,
but young Bennett was out of it for the rest
of the year.</p>

<p>Ripley occupied the mound for Damascus that
afternoon, and was discouragingly effective.
After “Hop” Nye had escaped punishment in the
first half of the initial inning by the skin of his
teeth, a fine stop of a possible two-bagger by
Cross and a phenomenal catch of a long fly by
O’Neill warding off disaster, Harrisville went in
to be mowed down one, two, three by the elongated
spit-ball artist of the visiting club. No one got
the ghost of a hit in that inning or any other while
Ripley was in the box; no one on the home team,
that is. Damascus had better luck, touching up
Nye for three hits with a total of five bases, but
failing to score for all of that. The game went to
the sixth a pitcher’s battle pure and simple, with
Ripley getting the long end of it, both teams working
like beavers and not a runner passing second.</p>

<p>Wayne’s opportunities to distinguish himself
were few, for strike-outs were numerous. Four
chances were accepted by him in the first five
innings, but none was difficult. At the bat, he followed
Manager Milburn’s advice the first time up
and tried his best to work a pass. But Ripley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
was not generous that way and Wayne soon
walked back to the bench with the umpire’s
“He’s out!” in his ears. In the last of the fifth,
with LaCroix on first base and none out, he had
a second trial at the plate and, after getting in
the hole, landed on a straight ball and smacked it
squarely into third baseman’s hands.</p>

<p>It was in the sixth inning that the ice was
broken by Damascus. Before anyone realised it
she had filled the bases with only one out. Nye
was plainly wabbling and “Red” Herring and
Nick Crane were warming up back of third. The
Damascus left fielder landed on the first pitch
and Cross got it on the bound and hurled it to
the plate. But the throw was wide and, although
Young made the catch, the runner was safe and
Damascus had scored. She scored again a minute
later when the following batsman flied out to short
left, for the best “Sailor” O’Neill could do was
to hold the next runner at third. With two gone,
a hit out of the infield was imperative and the
Damascus catcher tried his best to get it. That
he didn’t was no one’s fault but Wayne’s, for he
started the ball off his bat at a mile a minute and
streaked down the base path, while the other
bags emptied like magic. Four yards to the left
of first base sped the ball, ascending as it went.
LaCroix stabbed at it and missed it by inches and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
it was Wayne, who had started with the sound
of the hit, who leaped into the air behind LaCroix
and brought joy to the stands and sorrow to
Damascus. That circus catch, for it was scarcely
less, started Wayne on the road to fame, a fame
at present presaged by cheers and hand-clapping
as, somewhat embarrassed, he walked back to the
bench.</p>

<p>“Lift your cap,” chuckled Cross as he and
Wayne neared the first base stand. “Where’s
your manners, kid?”</p>

<p>Wayne obeyed sketchily and dropped onto the
bench aware of the amused glances of his team
mates. From the other end Mr. Milburn nodded
to him. “Good stop, Sloan,” he said. But that
was all.</p>

<p>Harrisville again failed to hit or score and the
seventh began. Nye was derricked when he had
passed the first man up and “Red” Herring
ambled to the mound. “Red” was wild for a few
minutes but then settled down and, after Young’s
clever peg to Cross had retried the man from first,
the inning was virtually over. A long fly to right
and a stop and throw by Jones settled matters.</p>

<p>The seventh witnessed a change of fortunes.
“Sailor” O’Neill led off with a clean single and
LaCroix advanced him to second and reached
first safely. Ripley retired then and a left-hander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
named Marks took his place. Marks was a man
of wide curves and slow delivery. Wayne tried
desperately to get a hit but fanned, which, considering
that his advance to the plate had been
greeted by applause, was horribly humiliating.
But Leary found Marks for one, scoring O’Neill
and putting LaCroix on third. Young flied out to
deep centre and LaCroix scored, Leary advancing.
Herring smashed a liner to shortstop too hot to
handle and Leary beat out the subsequent throw
to the plate by inches. Cross hit safely but was
doubled up with Briggs a few minutes later.</p>

<p>Damascus came back in the first of the eighth
and added another run, tying the score at three
each. Herring passed the first man up and although
he struck out the next two, a momentary
let-down paved the way for a two-bagger and
sent the tying tally across. A moment later a
quick peg from Herring caught the runner at
second a foot off the bag and brought relief to
the anxious audience.</p>

<p>Jones started the last of the eighth for Harrisville
by flying out to pitcher. O’Neill, undaunted,
waited until the score was two-and-three and then
busted the next offering through the infield for a
long rolling hit that placed him on second and
wrought the spectators to a frenzy of delight.
LaCroix was up next and Wayne followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>LaCroix. Wayne was wondering anxiously
whether he would have better success this time.
Already four hits had been made off Marks, proving
that he was far from formidable, and yet
when Wayne, swinging his bats between bench
and plate, saw LaCroix match his wits against
Marks’ and come off second best in the contest
it seemed futile for him to hope to succeed. LaCroix
swung at one and missed it, judged two
balls wisely, fouled into the first base stand for a
second strike and then let go at one and popped
it nicely into shortstop’s glove. Wayne dropped
one of the two bats he had been swinging and
stepped to the rubber.</p>

<p>Two out, a man on second and a run needed to
break the tie! A hit, nothing less, was expected
of Wayne, and he realised it. At first the thought
was horribly disturbing. He heard the applause
from the stands, less hearty this time, since he
had failed them before, and it added to his
tremors. He felt himself absurdly young and
inexperienced and—yes, actually scared! He
wished himself back on the bench, any place save
where he stood, facing the pitcher with the
muscles at the back of his legs trembling! They
were talking to him and at him, his own side
and the enemy, but what they said was confused
and meaningless, and it was not until the Damascus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
catcher called down to his pitcher to “Fan the
kid, Walt!” that any words registered on his
brain.</p>

<p>“Fan the kid!” That meant him. He didn’t
mind being called a kid by his fellow players, but
the catcher’s tone was a veiled insult, and something
very much like anger welled up in Wayne’s
breast. He tugged down his visor, seized the bat
more firmly, and determined to show them that a
kid could hit! He made up his mind then and
there to forget everything but the task in front
of him, to even forget that there were already two
out and that so much depended on him, and suddenly,
why he couldn’t have told, the certainty
that he <em>could</em> hit possessed him firmly.</p>

<p>Marks looked him over. He leaned forward to
get the catcher’s signal. Then he stood for an
instant and Wayne knew that he was undecided
what to offer him. “I’ll have a good look at the
first one,” Wayne told himself, “no matter what
it is!”</p>

<p>And when it came it was well worth looking at,
for it was a nice curve over the corner of the
plate and was a strike.</p>

<p>“’Ata, boy!” called the Damascus catcher.
“You’ve got him beaten, Walt.” But Wayne paid
no heed. <a href="#image04">His conviction that he could hit that
ball was still strong.</a> He had watched the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
offering all the way and had had no trouble keeping
it in sight. Marks evidently thought his curve
ball, an outcurve to a right-handed batter, had
fooled the latter once and that he had better try
it again. Wayne was ready for it and meant to
try very hard to hook it low into right field. His
guess was correct, for what came was the same
sort of delivery. But it was a little lower and
Wayne missed it and heard the second strike
called on him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="image04">
  <img src="images/image04.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_298">His Conviction that he Could Hit that Ball Was Still Strong</a></div>
</div>

<p>But even yet he was confident. With two strikes
against him he still felt certain of getting that hit.
It surely looked as if Marks had him in a hole,
but Wayne somehow knew that he hadn’t. Followed
then two wide ones, just outside the plate,
and Wayne, expecting them, made no offer. He
knew that Marks was tempting him to bite at
them and resolutely held back. And then came
the fifth delivery.</p>

<p>It looked good as it left the pitcher’s hand. It
was coming to Wayne about waist-high and he
thought it would break toward him and drop a
trifle. As it neared the plate he stepped to meet
it, and when it broke he put all his strength into
the lunge and tried to send it between first baseman
and the bag. He met it hard and started
with the crack of the bat. He saw the ball shooting
low inside the foul line, saw first baseman leap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
toward it, and, digging harder than ever, saw
the ball strike the bag and go bounding out into
the field!</p>

<p>He knew then that he was safe, knew that he
had done what was expected of him, and was
terrifically glad. As he turned first he saw second
baseman standing idle and heard the voice of
Steve Milburn in the coaching box yelling him on,
and he legged it hard for second. He saw the ball
coming in then, but the throw was to the plate and
he slid to second unchallenged. As he got to his
feet again he was fairly dismayed by the pandemonium
that arose from the stands, and then, for
the first time since he had determined to forget
everything save the business of hitting the ball,
he remembered O’Neill!</p>

<p>Anxiously he looked to third. He was not there.
But of course not! He had either scored or been
put out at the plate! He turned to the Damascus
shortstop. “Did you get him?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” was the disgusted reply. “He was safe
by a mile!”</p>

<p>And then Wayne understood why the stands
were cheering and roaring! Harrisville had
scored! The Badgers were one run to the good!</p>

<p>Gradually the babel of sound died away. Leary
was at bat. Wayne led off, danced back again,
keeping an eye on the shortstop, watching the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
pitcher as well, listening to warnings from the
coachers. If only Leary would come through!
But Leary failed. A sharp crack, a sudden leaping
dive by second baseman as Wayne sped along
the path, a left-hand toss to first and the inning
was over, and Wayne, turning disappointedly back
to his position, heard the cheers and clapping
break forth afresh, and wondered!</p>

<p>It was all over ten minutes later, all over, that
is, but the shouting, and that didn’t last long
after the Harrisville players scuttled from field
to dressing-room. In the doorway, smiling
broadly now, stood Mr. Milburn, and as Wayne
pushed through with the rest the manager’s arm
shot out and seized on his shoulder and dragged
him aside.</p>

<p>“I’m going to tear up that contract, Sloan,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Tear it up!” faltered Wayne.</p>

<p>“Yes.” The manager’s eyes twinkled. “It
wasn’t any good, anyway! Tomorrow I’ll have
a new one ready for you. I’m going to sign you
on to play second base, Sloan, at a hundred and
ten a month. That suit you?”</p>

<p>Wayne only nodded, but the expression on his
face was answer enough. Mr. Milburn laughed
and pushed him good-naturedly on. “All right!
Sign up tomorrow morning, and——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>But his remark was never finished, for just then
there was an excited barking outside and a little
yellow dog burst through the doorway and leaped
at the boy. And following Sam appeared the
grinning face of June.</p>

<p>“Mas’ Wayne, sir, I hear down to the hotel as
you-all’s playin,” panted June, “an’ I jus’
nachally had to come, sir! I reckon I done lose
my job, but I ain’ carin’!”</p>

<p>“Never mind your job,” laughed Wayne, as he
picked Sam up in his arms. “You’ve got a new
job after today, June.”</p>

<p>“Say I is? What I goin’ do, Mas’ Wayne?”</p>

<p>“You’re going to look after me, June; and Sam.
We’re going to find those rooms tomorrow and go
to keeping house. We—we’re going to live like
white folks again!”</p>

<p>“Lawsy-y-y!” cried June.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
